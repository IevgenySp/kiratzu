This was a birthday trip to mother and sister and I wanted everything to be as perfect as possible. Chantal the resident manager made it all happen with the most warm and personal touches including balloons champagne a cake and gifts waiting in our room upon our arrival. Chantal and I had been emailing each other in the weeks preceeding the trip and I felt as if I knew her as a friend when we finally arrived.  This was by far the best hotel I have stayed at in London out of my previous 4 stays. The hotel itself is quaint yet beautiful with a cozy at-home feeling. From the street the entrance is quite inconspicuous and private which is very nice. The overall style is what I would describe as contemporary old-world style meets traditional English. The executive lounge is a large gorgeous living room type of space with multiple seating areas that are also for the morning breakfast sittings. In the evenings a well stocked bar is set up for evening cocktails. The very unconventional reception area is also here in this room as a mere executive desk with a flat screen computer monitor and two guest chairs. There's also an open loft in this room with additional seating desks and computers for business use.  The bedrooms themselves are absolutely lovely consistent with the look and feel of the rest of the hotel and very well equiped with everything you could possibly need. A web-tv type of set-up with cordless keyboard makes e-mail and internet access so very convenient. There is a fax machine mini bar cordless telephone to use anywhere in the hotel spacious closets and bathroom large enough to accomodate 3 of us ladies staying in the same room (now that is important!). There was a separate shower and bathtub and a lot of counter space.  I could go on and on about this place. Chantal and her staff could not be any more cordial and accomodating. We had originally planned to stay 4 days and 4 nights but ended up staying and extra day since we were having so much fun. Needless to say I would stay at the 41 again and again and highly recommend it!","2013-09-17T14:47:08","112565.0","0","2013-09-17T11:22:27","ZD111570","Alabama","2014-01-01T00:00","35894","5.0"

There was a lovely basket of tea and coffee as well as a package of microwavable popcorn. Everything was there that a person might need including a jar of hard candies.  We were given a king room on a smoking floor although we had requested non-smoking. We tried to live with it but later in the evening we had to request a different room. They did give us another room on a non-smoking floor and we enjoyed it.  We especially enjoyed their pool on the top floor. The water was warm and the view of all the tall buildings right from the pool was lovely. We enjoyed it so much that we got up early the next morning and went in again before breakfast.  The breakfast was bountiful including everything that was needed to make your own Belgium waffles. The breakfast included hot food and cold cereals as well as fresh fruit. We really enjoyed our comfortable beds especially the comforters which I think were down-filled. And there were 3 fluffy pillows on each bed. No need to call for another pillow! We regretted that we had to leave so soon. It would have been nice to stay for the free supper with the manager that was being served the next night.

The dining room in which it was served was lovely. Service was outstanding. Everyone on the staff was very professional and courteous. This is an Italian chain so there was a bit of a language problem at times but it was a minor inconvenience. The lobby was very smoky but they did have have no-smoking areas in the lounge.

The view from my room was also nice. In response to complaints made towards the club access it seemed to me that the hotel had worked the problems out for the small extra I paid was definitely worth it. The food at the lounge was very good and nothing beats having the ability to check out late and having access to many personalized services. From the receptionist to the housekeeper to the driver of the house car which I was offered to use on my way to the Caltrain station all my interactions were provided with smile and welcoming response and action. Let me inform you however that the location of the hotel on top of a hill can be challenging to some guests. Also the hotel elevators were small and access to them can be time consuming during busy instances.

The rooms are spacious compared with other Vegas hotels and we found them pleasant and comfortable. We had few meals at the hotel. The food was average but not too expensive.

However I was sorely mistaken. In all objectivity it could not have been a bad hotel rooms were very clean the internet price was good for London and the continetal breakfast was pretty good.  However the desk staff including the hotel manager were very rude and condescending to me when I needed to address a problem that arose. To make a long story short the hotel added a 100 pound service fee to a phone call that should have cost less than 25 pounds (researched on British Telecom for actual price of the call) When politely questioned they at first told me the 20 minute cal I made lasted for 10 hours and that's why the call cost 130 pounds. Then they said the call lasted 261 minutes and that's why it cost 130 pounds. finally they said the call lasted 20 minutes and still cost 130 pounds.  The way they handled the explaination of the bill seems shady to me not to mention the rude way I was spoken to as though I were a dumb american.  Since they had my credit card number and security I had to sign the charge slip (though I wrote it was under duress on both copies) My Visa will be handling them now...

Nothing real fancy cozy and quaint rooms the courtyard setting is great with birds chirping etc. Wild parrots flew overhead a couple of times.- Great location with restaurants shopping Golden Gate Bridge Marina Palace of Fine Arts public transport nearby. 10-15 minute bus ride to the Wharf.- Garages - the garages are kind of a free-for-all but we never had a difficult time finding an open slot. But...if you can park underneath your own unit it's recommended. One night we missed our spot and in the morning we could feel the another guests car doors shut and motors start. The entry into the garages are pretty narrow but we have a 2001 BMW 740iL and we were able to squeeze it in pretty nicely.- No A/C - but our stay couldn't have had better weather. Spring sunny little bit of a breeze and cool temps...nice San Francisco days. We opened the windows during the day-time when we were in the room and closed them in the evening. No noise from the street seems too loud.- Room location - the lay-out of the motel is a big U with units/garages along the outside of the U and an island of units/garages in the center. We had a corner unit at the north end of the island. Not too much street noise at all. We had two windows in the room itself and a window in the bathroom. I loved the airy atmosphere.- Small microwave small refrigerator coffee maker with coffee and hot chocolate- TV had a DVD player. We brought our own DVDs but a Blockbuster is just up the street on Lombard.- Bathroom - was probably re-done a couple of years ago and very nice. The shower is relatively large with lots of water pressure and nice high shower head (the freakishly tall husband of mine loved that feature) there were two sinks in our bathroom with was actually very nice since we had two teenage girls (phew!) everything worked great. The towels aren't nice 'n fluffy-like but there were plenty of them. Shampoo and lotion was provided but bring conditioner.- Steam heater (I think that's what it's called) - the room has an old-fashioned steam heater and it does make noise. We had to turn it off in the middle of the night because it went through some cycles and it made quite a bit of noise. No big deal.- Beds - (2) full size beds - We had my daughter and her friend share a bed the husband had his own (remember - he's freakishly tall) and I slept on a roll-away. My bed was just right. I didn't hear any complaints from the kids or husband either. Pillows were kinda hard but not bad.I did see other guests with their dogs and wished I had mine with me. A few families and some foreign visitors (Brits?). The management was friendly and helpful. At check-in we were given a 2-for-1 coupon to Judy's Cafe on Chestnut about 2 1/2 blocks from the motel. Good food and service.I would stay at this motel again.","2013-09-17T15:08:46","134728.0","2","2013-09-17T12:15:51","ZD111226","Missouri","2001-01-01T00:00","63385","5.0"

I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to a lakefront view room upon a fast check-in. It was my first time in this hotel so I didn't really know what to expect given the upgrade. On the way to the 29th floor I immediately noticed how well maintained the hotel was. The public spaces hallways the details were just polished and clean. Elevators were fast as well. The room I must say was great. It was very spacious immaculately clean and modern. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was all marble with separated shower and tub. And the view? Just breathtaking. That's when I realized why it was an upgrade. The view of the lake Navy pier Chicago river and even the Hancock building  all infront of you just accentuated my experience to another level. I would pay extra given the location of this room. I had many planned activities for this 2 night stay and I have to admit that I had a hard time leaving the room especially at night when the beauty of Chicago was just in front of you. I cannot comment on room services however the staff in the front desk were professional and helpful. I have stayed in several Chicago hotels including 5 star properties but I have to say that for the value and amenities alone it's hard to go wrong with the Swissotel.

We were right in the center of the theater district walking distance to central park time square and many other sights. We arrived during the first real cold spell of the winter.

We usually stay on the Strip to be close to everything but we decided to make this a different type of Vegas trip. We arrived at approximately 8:30 on a monday night. We were greeted with smiles and our checkin was quick and easy. The outside of the hotel was beautiful as was the lobby. Our room was pretty nice. We had a one bedroom villa facing the mountains. Fully stocked kitchen sliding wood shutters and a balcony greeted us. The master bathroom was pretty large and the whirlpool bath was large enough for myself and my husband. The small second bathroom was a nice addition. We didn't have to run to the bathroom in the bedroom! =) The pool was huge! Both sides were open and several families were taking advantage of the pool floats and noodles. My 4 year old son loved the floats! The waterslides looked fun however my son was to small to ride. One lifeguard I spoke to said they even offered catchers. They would wait at the bottom of the slide for your child to come down. I thought that was really cool. The jacuzzi's (approx 5 of them) were really nice and the hammocks rocked! We found the staff to be extremely friendly and quick to accomodate. The burgers were delicious! Especially the chili burgers didn't have to carry cash around the resort we just charged everything to the room and paid at checkout. There was no construction noise and housekeeping knocked politely at 10 am to see if we needed anything. There was no Strip noise (only a 10 minute drive to MGM) and ladies the best thing of all was the Las Vegas Fashion Outlet store was a block away! Shopping! I would definately return here for a quiet Vegas retreat. They even offer activities for children! Arts and Crafts and other classes. Very nice.

The Queen has been supplanted by the Lowes Vogue or the Delta as the place to be in the city. The rooms aren't particularly big for a luxury hotel. The one plus to this place is a large pool and a nicely equiped gym. Like all those others expect to spend C$75/day on top of the listed price for the taxes parking and whatnot. If you aren't addicted to five star service and want the real Montreal experience I'd prefer the Chateau d'Argoat to all of them.

For the most part hotel personnel were friendly and helpful. For example the wonderful concierge directed us to a nearby restaurant that served the best Italian food I've ever tasted. When he learned that one of my friends had forgotten his belt and needed to get his hands on one quickly for a social function he took off his own belt and let my friend borrow it!  However the front desk attendants were terrible. When we tried to check into the hotel after 3pm only one of the three rooms we had reserved was ready. The attendants seemed indifferent and appeared as if they had no idea what was going on. Although we had made our reservations weeks in advance and had requested a block of rooms the rooms we ended getting were on three different floors. The next day I had a plumbing problem that rendered my bathroom toilet inoperable and the floor soaking wet. I notified one of the very same front desk attendants about the problem at 2:30pm. When I returned to the hotel around midnight nothing had been done. Instead of going to bed I had to wait around for a maintenance man to arrive and fix the problem (once he got there it took less than two minutes to fix it). The internet service in my room (which cost around $12 for a few hours) did not work at all. The keyboard was apparently broken. The hotel elevators were the smallest I've ever seen. Even from my eleventh floor room I could hear excessive street noise. The most annoying sound came from the hotel valet who constantly blew a loud whistle to summon taxi cabs. There was an empty ice bucket with drinking glasses in my room but the hotel does not have any ice machines for guests. Room service brought some ice in a bucket and took the empty bucket away. All in all the Whitehall did not meet my expectations. Although the building was charming and its location was ideal I would not recommend the Whitehall to anyone looking for the service and amenities of a true luxury hotel.

The staff that welcomed us were very pleasant and helpful and they were throughout our stay. Our room was lovely and spacious. When we discovered that pets could also stay at the hotel we wished that we could get our pets from back home and just stay for the month. There was a lovely basket of tea and coffee as well as a package of microwavable popcorn. Everything was there that a person might need including a jar of hard candies.  We were given a king room on a smoking floor although we had requested non-smoking. We tried to live with it but later in the evening we had to request a different room. They did give us another room on a non-smoking floor and we enjoyed it.  We especially enjoyed their pool on the top floor. The water was warm and the view of all the tall buildings right from the pool was lovely. We enjoyed it so much that we got up early the next morning and went in again before breakfast.  The breakfast was bountiful including everything that was needed to make your own Belgium waffles. The breakfast included hot food and cold cereals as well as fresh fruit. We really enjoyed our comfortable beds especially the comforters which I think were down-filled. And there were 3 fluffy pillows on each bed. No need to call for another pillow! We regretted that we had to leave so soon. It would have been nice to stay for the free supper with the manager that was being served the next night.

The many ethnic restaurants of Queensway are a five minute walk away. It's just a very short block off busy Bayswater Road but very quiet. The rooms in the hotel are very small by US standards and the hallways are like a maze But the associated good news is that many hallways have only one or two rooms on them so they are very quiet. The single room I stayed in faced a rather ugly internal courtward but was extremely quiet. The desk in the room was big enough to plug in my laptop to work on even if the room was a littel claustrophobic. By booking through the Best Western website well in advance I got an excellent rate--62.5 pounds per night--much better than I have gotten in other recent stays in equivalent London hotels.

Don't get me wrong you have a beautiful hotel •À_ but the staff at reception was un-welcoming and later once arriving at our room and heading down to the pool the bartenders in the pool area were completely out of line. I was sunbathing with my girlfriends by the pool ordering drinks all morning. It wasn't until 4pm when I went to go get everyone some Pi•À_a Colada's that the bartender asked me for ID. I simply smiled and told him that that day was my birthday I had been ordering drinks all morning and that I was 26. He replied with a snotty : No ID No Drinks.I was appalled. Not only was he rude but he made me feel like a criminal. Not only did my tab total more than $200 •À_ but this person was treating me like I was asking him to GIVE me a free drink. Regardless I know that rules are rules and that they need ID in order to purchase a drink but what happened next is the true reason of this email.Seeing that I was upset my girlfriends offered to purchase the drinks - since some had brought their IDs. We noticed that the group of girls next to us did just that (one baught drinks for all of them). So my friend went to purchase the drinks and again the snooty bartender said that one of us didn't have ID and that he needed all of our IDs in order to sell my friend drinks. This was a double standard for you see why did he sell the group of girls next to us 5 pi•À_a coladas and he refused service to my friend?The problem didn't end there. He then proceeded to ask security to pay us a visit •À_ totally humiliating us in front of new friends we had made at the pool •À_ and proceed to inform us that we had been cut off. That if I personally was seeing with a beverage in hand I would be kicked out of the pool area. As you can imagine my morning/afternoon was completely ruined. I could have gone up to get my ID but the fact that your hotel decided to cut off my friends as well made us so angry. You can be very sure that we will be telling our friends family and colleagues about this experience.As I didn't want to further ruin my day I decided to lounge by the pool (all this time by being watched closely by security guards) and then proceed up to my room. I was outraged by this experience. When I went to Bare at the Mirage they treated me like they wanted me to be there like a guest not like a teenager attempting to steal liquor. I did not file a complaint while at the Palms because as you can imagine I did not want to ruin the rest of my birthday.(I even had dinner reservations at NOVE which I cancelled for not wanting to spend time at your hotel!)I really hope this email helps your hotel live up to the reputation that it claims to have. To me it was no different than staying at the Holiday Inn.Kindest Regards","2013-09-17T12:25:06","137298.0","5","2013-09-17T10:14:11","ZD111203","Utah","2000-01-01T00:00","84606","5.0"

The Queen has been supplanted by the Lowes Vogue or the Delta as the place to be in the city. The rooms aren't particularly big for a luxury hotel. The one plus to this place is a large pool and a nicely equiped gym. Like all those others expect to spend C$75/day on top of the listed price for the taxes parking and whatnot. If you aren't addicted to five star service and want the real Montreal experience I'd prefer the Chateau d'Argoat to all of them.

I booked this hotel for its great value ($79 total/nt on priceline) and because I wanted to experience what Vegas is. And I did because Vegas is a city that doesn't sleep and neither did I. A strip view room has a great view but remember that construction on the strip goes 24/7 and even my trusted earplugs couldn't block it out. If we were staying longer I would have asked to move to a different room.So if you want to party and sleep is the last thing on your mind -- this place is perfect for you!Service in the hotel just like everywhere in Vegas is all about tips.

We booked our tickets at the reception for the tourist buses so we had to get ready in 2 hours time. The fantastic facilities available in the room helped everything go on smoothly.

MGC has a great location right next to Planet Hollywood (going by the lower case •À_ph•À_) which is almost done with the redecorating from the old Aladdin although the mall part still needs much work. There was no trouble getting a cab (my preferred means of transit) which was a big plus over other non-casino lodging. I could also walk to MGM but it was quite a walk and past some of the cheap trinket shops and a 24 hr Walgreens (also nice to have close by). - Room •À_ First let me say that while I knew in advance that this was a timeshare/suite hotel that did not prepare me for the size of the room. It was quite spacious! Fully stocked kitchen (I don•À_t cook in Vegas when Chef Puck has so many choices for me!) along with a washer/dryer unit in the closet. King bed was very comfy. Double shower heads were fantastic and water pressure was good. Soaking tub was a great option on the last night when I wanted to wash all the Vegas dust off and prepare to return to the •À_real•À_ world. There was some plumbing noise and the AC unit was louder than most. The outside of the windows were really dirty because of the construction outside. The windows blocked most of the construction noise from the ph tower that was being erected not 250 feet from my room! - Service •À_ I only had my room cleaned once while I was there. Standard care nothing extraordinary. The valets and bellmen were all really friendly and appreciated being tipped (who doesn•À_t) but weren•À_t as pushy as some can be in sin city! - •À_timeshare•À_ •À_ I thought I was going to be overwhelmed with pushy sales people trying to get me to •À_take the tour•À_ and •À_experience the difference of ownership•À_ but that just didn•À_t happen. I was offered to come to one meeting and that was it. The staff never asked me again and I was treated no differently than anyone else in the place. Although there was an owners•À_ lounge which I did not try to use•À_they need their perks! - The Roof •À_ This is only place I have stayed in Vegas to date that offered guests access to the roof. I enjoyed this and would consider it a true plus to staying here. There is something about getting a panoramic view of the strip that gives it a whole different appearance (see photos).","2013-09-17T14:20:16","141242.0","-3","2013-09-17T09:49:35","ZD111243","Florida","1997-01-01T00:00","34447","5.0"

It's in an area of downtown that is quiet (except for the construction...see last part of review) and clean. You can easily walk to Old Montreal without having to stay in the chaos. - The breakfast is good. Cooked to order omlettes fresh fruit etc. Pretty typical for an Embassy Suites. The weekend we were there it was very busy and crazy. We usually took our trays up to our room where we could relax and enjoy eating. - The room was very clean and the pictures on the website were accurate. It was nice having a separate shower and jacuzzi tub. Yes the shower is small but the bathroom itself is very large. We were surprised at the mirrored makeup counter that made it easy for two people to get ready at the same time. And It was nice to unwind in the jacuzzi tub after a day with miles of walking.- The bedroom is separate in a way. Not a typical Embassy Suites set up. It is separated by pocket doors from the living area. Not a big deal but something to be aware of if you have people sleeping on the pullout sofa.- Parking is expensive ($26/day - valet only). There is a garage right across the street for less. We were charged for 2 days valet instead of 1. Once pointed out  we were refunded by the front desk manager immediately.- And about the construction. Try to stay in an odd numbered room/one facing the front of the hotel. The building across from the backside of the hotel started construction at 5:55am (seriously no joke). It did stop on Saturday and Sunday but Friday morning was miserable!All-in-all we would stay here again.","2013-09-17T13:56:46","155909.0","2","2013-09-17T10:08:37","ZD111232","Illinois","1977-01-01T00:00","60425","5.0"

Here is a letter we sent to the Manager European Customer Service and head Office in the US. We were told the Manager would be in contact.....we are still waiting. ......Mr Martin NewbouldHouse ManagerRadisson Edwardian May Fair Hotel LondonStratton StreetLondon W1A 2AN EnglandMs Anne GottwaldGuest Relations ManagerRadisson Edwardian May Fair Hotel LondonStratton StreetLondon W1A 2AN EnglandMs Marilyn Carlson NelsonChairman and Chief Executive OfficerCarlson CompaniesPO Box 59159Minneapolis MN 55459 USADear SirsI am writing to express my utter displeasure and disappointment in my recent stay at your hotel the •À_grand five-star•À_ Radisson Edwardian Mayfair for the dates 30 June-3 July 2005.I arrived with my wife and two-year-old daughter shortly after midnight on 1 July and departed after noon on 3 July. We were lodged in room 608 and we made the bookings on the internet pre-paying a deposit of over •À_500.My dissatisfaction was due to the following;1 July;-Access to the room was inconvenient at best. We had to first walk up a flight of stairs then through a fire door needing a key to open then down two lengthy hallways one of which included additional stairs before taking a service elevator. -There was no mini-bar as confirmed with our booking on the Radisson.com website. The refrigerator was there but it did not work was at room temperature and had nothing more than a bottle of warm water in it. When we queried the staff on check-in and again Friday afternoon we were told that the lack of mini-bar was a •À_management decision•À_ that none of the rooms (old or new) had mini-bars and that there was nothing they would do about it. In addition to our previous two discussions with desk staff about this we spoke to the duty manager on leaving the hotel and she stated the the minibar should at least work which it did not. She further explained that a group of guests had been polled and as a result a •À_management•À_ decision had been made to provide mini-bars where clients would have a choice to pay for beverages supplied by the hotel or additional bar fridge space where they could place their own items. If this is the case a common sense •À_management•À_ decision with guest consideration in mind would be that the old system should remain available until the new one is ready to be implemented. An empty warm fridge does not provide access to either. -To get something to drink I ordered two beers from room service. I stressed that they must be cold. After a 30 minute wait two lukewarm beers arrived. In order to avoid further waiting I took the warm beers down the long journey to the front desk myself to exchange them for cold ones which were available all along.-Various fixtures in the room were loose and falling apart including the shower water knob the bin in the bathroom the light fixtures in the ceiling and most importantly a wall socket that was pulled out exposing the wires and bare connections. This was a hazard to my two year old daughter and I would think a safety code violation in the United Kingdom.-Both the entrance door and the bathroom door had holes made for a door bolt / lock however neither of these doors were finished completely and lacked these details. The bathroom door has a hole where the lock should be the main door had part of the chain door lock in place but was missing key parts.- Since we arrived in late the night before and I had business meetings beginning at 11 AM and lasting all day I hoped to be able to sleep later than 8 AM which is the hour we were awakened by the hammering sawing and drilling noise going on in the hotel renovations in the next wing.-In the evening we asked for an extra bath towel from the maid service. Two hours later it had not arrived and we had to phone again. 2 July; - We were awakened again on Saturday by the construction noise. - There were problems with the service lift on and off all day Saturday and into Sunday morning. One could only discover the problem by waiting by the lift to see if it would arrive because there was never any notification on the lift or elsewhere. Access to the room was now up an additional five flights of stairs but at least possible. The greater challenge was getting back down as the stairwell door on the first floor was locked from the inside without so much as a handle to grab onto to try to open it from the stairway side. As far as I knew this was the only access to the lobby. I only found my way out by going into the renovation work and asking the workmen how to get out. This caused me to be late to a business appointment waiting for me in the lobby. The inconvenience aside I am sure that this was a safety code violation. In the event of a fire there was no escape route. At 13:00 on Saturday I informed a young lady at the front desk of the problem and showed it to her as she tried to help me get to my room. A simple door stop could have been a temporary solution but at 17:00 the door was still locked. -Saturday night at 9 PM I tried again to order room service. I asked for a mixed salad. I was told this was only available on the night menu after 11PM. In fact there was no green salad available. I then asked for a pizza and was told I had an out-dated menu and so had to wait while a porter brought up the new one. To deny a guest a simple plate like a green salad when the ingredients are readily available strikes me as well stupid. It•À_s certainly not five star •À_prestigious•À_ service. Does the hotel not have lettuce and tomatoes during daylight hours? Is the hotel at all concerned with customer service?3 July;Due to the out-of-order lifts my wife seven months pregnant and carrying a 15 kg toddler after waiting in vain for the lift was forced to climb the extra five floors of stairs to get up to the 6th floor room. We do not believe that the hotel was giving value for money.Given that the •À_first section of new bedrooms is currently under construction and is due for completion in June•À_ I question as to why we were placed in an incomplete room in July and why indeed the hotel was taking bookings for a service that was inadequate and that it was most certainly unable to provide. One is able to understand that renovations are often necessary for the improvement and modernization of facilities in an attempt to provide better services and it is possible to allow reasonable leverage in considering this.However in our experience the Radisson Edwardian Mayfair is in no state to be currently claiming to be providing a luxury service in fact it is in no state to be taking reservations for the section of hotel we were roomed in. The standard we found was far below that expected of a five star hotel with severe safety violations that require serious and immediate attention.I was in London principally for business. I found it difficult to conduct business in a professional manner in the Radisson. I was tired from lack of sleep due to the noise and late for an appointment due to being locked in a stairwell. As a golf course manager I once worked with the Meridien hotel chain. I understand that there are people who will trump up complaints and problems in order to gain concessions in prices from the hotel. I did not ask for any discounts and I am not doing so now. I want to be sure that you understand that my dissatisfaction is genuine and the reasons why in the future I will avoid Radisson Hotels in general and your hotel in particular.

It is not. It is very close though (it's deliberately misleading)- The surround area looks awful. However it is in a very good location - very central with excellent transport links. Just for 30 seconds to City Road where you can get virutally any bus to Angel tube station (takes 3 mins by bus). From there you can go anywhere pretty fast. Angel is great for shoppping bars etc.(Angel has a Marks and Spencer Sainsburys Toni &amp; Guy Nandos... everything. From Angel there are LOADS of buses going to Oxford Street etc.)- The extremely frequent bus 214 goes to Liverpool Street. It doesn't take very long...- After dark yes the area is quite dangerous. It is not far from Old Street on the border of Hackney and Islington. But during the day you are perfectly safe.- The reception area of this hotel is really beautiful/posh . The health club is fairly good as well - jacuzzi free towel to use friendly staff etc. There are some very cheap rates for this hotel on the weekends. The reason is simple. Most people only come to the City to work during the week (investment banker types) so it is quiet. This hotel is pretty good. Just remember when the surrounding buildings that appear dodgy are actually worth a lot because of the location. (central London - Zone 1) . Remember during daylight areas it is very safe (but still - be sensible - don't walk around with your ipod hanging out). Excellent tranpsort links - very close to Kings Cross Liverpool Street (cheap if you bus an Oyster Card...) JUST REMEMBER TO WALK TOWARDS CITY ROAD (main road) where there are loads of buses to Angel. It can be dodgy in other directions.Oh and I think there's free WIFI in the bar/restaurant so you can surf the net for free in your laptop.Remember - the hotel is just somewhere for you to sleep. If you want to go out and have fun in London go for this place.So in conclusion I think this IS a pretty good hotel. If you are lucky to get a cheap rate - go for it.Oh.. and one last thing... if I'm honest... sometimes the staff seem a little grouchy but that was just my experience on the day I was there.","2013-09-17T12:30:12","122036.0","3","2013-09-17T09:30:50","ZD111194","Nevada","1990-01-01T00:00","89140","5.0"

I went with my partner for 10 nights and it was simply perfect.The hotel was amazing from the decor to the service. 10 nights is the right amount of time and half-board is a MUST. The food at the brasserie for dinner was amazing with each night a different theme. The entertainment with the live band were great and fun. The swimming pool was relaxing along with the private beach. The staff were very friendly and helped us with a number of requests like booking a table at the Burj al arab. -Things i recommend-Sea view is beautiful which you can see the palm. Also it removes the noise from the construction.Half board is a must because not only are you saving big bucks but the food is AMAZING.Ask for an upgrade when you get there as there may be rooms available but the standard rooms are very good anyway.Taxi's are cheap so dont worry about travelling.Dollars are accepted and dont need to worry about Dihrams.Go to the Ski Dubai - one minute your in 35 degrees the next your freezing in icey conditions.Water park is superb and a great day out.The old deira is a must and buy some gold in the gold souk because its cheap and you can design what ever design you like. The malls are very big but tiring if your not a shopaholic.All in all an experience that will be hard to beat. When i go back to dubai it will be to this hotel and no where else because there is simply nothing better.","2013-09-17T14:28:27","122555.0","-4","2013-09-17T11:10:57","ZD111229","New York","1957-01-01T00:00","14650","5.0"

It's in an area of downtown that is quiet (except for the construction...see last part of review) and clean. You can easily walk to Old Montreal without having to stay in the chaos. - The breakfast is good. Cooked to order omlettes fresh fruit etc. Pretty typical for an Embassy Suites. The weekend we were there it was very busy and crazy. We usually took our trays up to our room where we could relax and enjoy eating. - The room was very clean and the pictures on the website were accurate. It was nice having a separate shower and jacuzzi tub. Yes the shower is small but the bathroom itself is very large. We were surprised at the mirrored makeup counter that made it easy for two people to get ready at the same time. And It was nice to unwind in the jacuzzi tub after a day with miles of walking.- The bedroom is separate in a way. Not a typical Embassy Suites set up. It is separated by pocket doors from the living area. Not a big deal but something to be aware of if you have people sleeping on the pullout sofa.- Parking is expensive ($26/day - valet only). There is a garage right across the street for less. We were charged for 2 days valet instead of 1. Once pointed out  we were refunded by the front desk manager immediately.- And about the construction. Try to stay in an odd numbered room/one facing the front of the hotel. The building across from the backside of the hotel started construction at 5:55am (seriously no joke). It did stop on Saturday and Sunday but Friday morning was miserable!All-in-all we would stay here again.","2013-09-17T12:30:02","100240.0","1","2013-09-17T11:43:08","ZD111547","Ohio","2013-01-01T00:00","45449","5.0"

We stayed here in Nov. 2007. We really wanted to stay at the Holiday Inn on Coram St. about a half block away as we had stayed there 2 years ago and loved the location. But the Holiday Inn was too expensive.So I booked the Royal National Hotel through British Airways. The price was $118 per night for 2 persons including all taxes and continental breakfast. That is cheap for London. The location is great. If you arrive at Heathrow Airport get on the tube and get off at the Russell Square stop. When you come out of the tube station - there is only one entrance - walk across the street and turn left. Then walk down to the next big street Woburn. Cross Woburn Street and turn right. The hotel entrance is about 50 feet on your left. The rooms are actually a bit larger than those at the nearby Holiday Inn. The bathroom is large and has a tub. But there were mildew stains in the bathroom. I guess I could have gone out and brought a bottle of bleach and scrubbed the tiles - but that's not my job. Our room looked out over a courtyard of sorts and was quiet. The worst part was the skinny mattress on the bed - not comfortable at all. The heat worked well and was easy to regulate ( no A/C in the rooms ). The continental breakfast was miserly - tea or coffee a diluted orange drink white bread butter and jam. This is the only place in the UK where I have ever had a lousy cup of tea. My wife refused to drink the coffee so we had to go to Starbucks every morning. This is a huge hotel - well over a thousand rooms.If they would put a decent bed in the room I might recommend it. This is London so bring lots of money . However ticket prices at the West End theaters are no worse than those on Broadway in New York.","2013-09-17T12:37:08","138582.0","-4","2013-09-17T10:05:36","ZD111163","Oregon","2004-01-01T00:00","97062","5.0"

THe bathroom is very small but the room and bathroom was clean and no issues with paint/wallpaper/cracks or bugs. Room service comes everyday and cleans the sink/tub/restroom takes all the old towels and give you new fresh towels toilet paper cups. They also include soap bars/ shampoo one use things and toothpaste. They made the bed sheets pillows etc and also the sofa bed if u leave it out. - We usually stayed away from room from 11 am - 2 am everyday and came back for naps.- The place is perfect location. Away from main congested loud roads and right smack on top of the 123(red) subway entrance (chambers) This is very very very handy. It is also a block away from the Blue line as well. - We have never been to nyc and away on our own but the nyc subway system is easy to learn after a few trial and errors. - The hotel has two entrance in and out. The front desk is open 24 hrs. We had a plumbing issue with toilet at 2 am and they came and fixed it.- There is only ONE elevator but it is also very slow. We were on the 7th floor and we could not hear the neighbors but often we would hear honking(tons of honking in nyc). But it didnt bother us.- A/C is controlled by a window unit. They include a wall hairblower. Alarm clock as well. Calls are not free. The room had a tv with few basic cable channels. The water had good flow and pressure.- Our rate was 156 ish after taxes a night but according to their website they will change the rates very soon. We looked at lots of other sites and hotels and this had the best rates and reviews.- We booked the reservations by phone about 3 weeks prior to coming. We had three people staying in the room and with the bed and the sofa opened up and all the luggage it was tight squeeze but no problem. - Room included a ceiling fan table and 3 drawers. ( the full bed sofa room)- Right above startbucks. We picked up various wi-fi signals but all were protected and some were unable to connect hehegeg. We occasionaly pick up free wifi from some networks wherever. - The lobby has racks of brochures and things for tourists and etc. Pick up the subway map becuase that will be with you at all times. Just tear out the manhattan one so the map will be smaller. - The website does great job of telling you exeactly how much it will cost a night after all fees. It was exactly that amt when the bill came out during checkout.- At night nyc the three of us 2 males/1 female ages 19-22. Did not have anyproblems. The streets may be dark but people walk around and cars drive. Just use common sense and there is always the taxis and the subway exit/entrace is right under the hotel so you wont have to walk far at all if u pop out at the right one on the block. Usually went back to hotel between 12 am-2 am. If u bank then there is a WAMU(washington mutual about a block away) Bank of america is around as well. Everything within the manhattan area is accessible by the subway and the red line rail that is next to the hotel is helpful and the blue one as well.","2013-09-17T14:07:10","152643.0","-1","2013-09-17T09:21:58","ZD111314","Texas","2004-01-01T00:00","75216","5.0"

The Stratford tube and train and bus stations are about 4 blocks away with cabbies available for aroound 5 pounds to the hotel with tip if you're too tired to walk.

For one thing red wine ought to be served at cellar temperature not room temperature. Good wine is available both in the restaurant and roof-top bar but the polite and pretty aspiring young actors serving us seem to have missed the sommelier's briefing. My feelings about the place were also affected negatively by the failure of the hotel to honour the Cdn. dollar booking rate we were quoted online when we booked our room blaming the internet booking agent for an error and refusing to compromise on the price in any way. The staff was very polite in how they explained to me why they should bear no responsibility for this but I think they were simply wrong and that they ought to have given us the hotel at the slight lower amount we were quoted and then taken it up with the online company.Finally the wireless internet didn't work very well. Staff eventually gave me a cable to let me hook up to a land line which worked well but maybe the hotel should consider investing in a better router.I see this is a pretty critical review that I have written. But I am writing it this way because I think this is a really good hotel overall and not mentioning these things will prevent it from becoming even better.","2013-09-17T11:23:29","154571.0","-4","2013-09-17T09:11:45","ZD111410","Utah","1974-01-01T00:00","84780","5.0"

This hotel is literally 90 seconds walk from Picadilly Circus; and yet it was nestled ideally in Jermyn Street. This allowed the hotel to be very quiet from the moment one entered - a hard task in London.- the staff - with one exception - were faultless. The reception area is rather bizarrely split naturally into a left hand and right hand desk with a pillar off-centre. This makes queueing less than straightforward or obvious. We queued at the left hand side. On the right hand side one of the receptionists finished with her guest. However she then kept her head down picked up some paperwork and - despite us evidently waiting and her never leaving the area - ignored us totally. For 4 star - and in relation to the rest of our experience - it was particularly poor.- Breakfast was served on a Sunday until noon - a great (and quite unusual) touch - it made the leisure trip all the better.- We had breakfast both mornings. On each occasion the service was sharp slick very professional seemingly entirely genuine and exactly what was required. On our 1st morning we went to the buffet - a customer came in an seated himself at our table without waiting for advice. We were not even aware of it when the team brought it to our attention!! It was discreet quiet without fuss and very apologetic. They even offered to move him if we insisted. Precisely for that reason we declined. A few moments later the manager (??) a lady&lt; again approached us and further apologised checking we were happy. At no stage did any of this seem disingenuous or false.- Afternoon tea was a pure delight. At •À_34 for 2 of us it was exquisitely presented fresh more than ample - very highly recommended as a treat.- the room was small but had been very well thought out and 2 of us had no problems.- the tv offers local information though we found this to be almost negligible. I would advise the hotel to consider beefing this up substantially. We speak English natively and know London. For people less familiar this may have been a trial - particularly when it has been advertised as being there.- we booked a late checkout for departure. At •À_10 per hour very good value; and with no sense of the all-too-often have you not gone yet staff tapping at the door. - we required a taxi more than once. The concierge was very happy to oblige and prompt in so doing. We didn't have to wait long. However he then did what we could have done and walked onto Jermyn Street to await a passing cab. I would recommend a direct dial / buzzer for the concierge to local taxis - it would have seemed a little less. haphazard. - Location simply cannot be faulted. For as central (theatre eating events attractions) as it is physically possible to get look no further.We will be staying again next year - and if the prices are anything like they are currently I would consider a similar experience a bargain.","2013-09-17T14:13:16","137752.0","-3","2013-09-17T09:04:14","ZD111602","Virginia","2013-01-01T00:00","24030","5.0"

It is located 5-10 minutes walk from the airport (depending how fast you walk); but too close to take a taxi. However not a pleasant walk mostly along dimly lit footpaths and under railway bridges. I wouldn't recommend it at night to people with a nervous disposition.I checked into the hotel about 7pm. Only one person on reception and a queue of 5-6 people which it took about 20 minutes to process. Not sure why but the check-in process was very slow. When I got to my room the first thing I noticed was the smell of wet carpet; seems like someone had tipped the contents of the kettle onto the floor. Under normal circumstances I would have asked for another room but was in a hurry to go out to an evening function and could not afford time to wait in the reception queue for another 20 minutes.When i got back to the hotel later that evening (about 11pm) my card key no longer worked. Again only one person on reception and only one person in front of me but it took 10-15 minutes to process him (part of the problem was that the hotel had run out of card keys) before I could get my card key re-set and to get into my smelly room. The best thing I can say is that the reception staff are very polite... I guess they have to be to placate frustrated guests.","2013-09-17T14:28:17","124657.0","3","2013-09-17T11:23:36","ZD111409","Wisconsin","2014-01-01T00:00","54432","5.0"

Were the convention center bulldozed tomorrow this place would close down because there's no other reason to come here. It's way off the Strip meaning everything is a monorail bus or cab ride away (I recommend the free Wynn shuttle bus from the monorail station until 8pm).Behind the hotel (east) are some garden apartments this New Yorker wouldn't walk past in the daylight. Walking south on Paradise Road you pass a couple of dicey motels and gas stations long before you reach civilization. The room never properly cooled off despite the thermostat being set to -- and allegedly registering at -- 65. The shower stall has one shelf -- at ankle level! What genius decided people should bend over to get the shampoo razor etc.? The pillows are like mush -- my $5 Wal-Mart ones at home are way more comfy! One elevator of four was broken at least two days. As for the staff apparently those complaint are right. The check-in clerk wasn't exactly $209/night friendly. One night I'm coming back exhausted and get stuck behind a baggage porter busy explaining things to some incoming guests hustling a bigger tip.

As someone who's been to Vegas numerous times I would've preferred to stay at a nice Strip hotel and use the monorail to/from the convention center. One positve: an in-room fridge which is rare in LV. With the savings from buying my own water and yogurt I could almost afford the $13/day Internet. Talk about nickel and diming a guest!I stay at Courtyards and other Marriott hotels all the time on my own dime. You'll get a warmer welcome and a nicer room in almost all of them.

The second night we discovered that the remote control didnt' work there were lightbulbs out in the room and the Internet was not working....and did I mention the air conditioner did not work.

In fact try to mention that you are a lawyer even if you aren't. That may scare them out of trying to scam you.My story is very very long. Let's just say that it is reminiscent of every other honest review of this rip off of a hotel. And let's just say that it ends with my husband and I standing in the middle of Hyde Street with a kind police officer who had to mediate to settle the matter with the psychotic woman (Kiki) who lied and told us she was the manager (We found out she lied when the sister hotel Fitzgerald told us that she was in fact not the manager). Yes we were standing there three thousand miles from home after a 6-hour flight and another 3 hours wandering the streets of SF because our room wasn't ready with all our luggage me crying the police officer reminding us that we were right and that we're better off getting the he-- out of there.And this talk I keep reading about Nob Hill's European charm? If cheap prints from the mall in even cheaper frames or chinzy cheesy decor (i.e. tulle draped over the rickety old bed.....barf) then you've never been to Europe. Maybe people think of Europe because of the cramped quarters and tiny elevator (that would tear off a small child's finger if they thought of poking their fingers through the gates that you have to close yourself! Yep...the elevator is THAT old...and no inspection sticker!)Crooks. Crooks. Crooks. Rude. Rude. Rude. Crazy. Crazy. Crazy. And I find it interesting that the good reviews of this place repeatedly mention the closeness to Union Square (woopeedoo....and it ain't that close) and the closeness to the trolley (puh-leeze). Sounds almost like a um ADVERTISEMENT?!?!?!?!?! Hmmmm...... Could it be? Might it be possible that these people are doing their own reviews? These individuals who wouldn't return our $500 cash deposit until the COPS WERE CALLED (and as shocking as this sounds read on to other reveiws.....we're not the only ones who had to use these measures!) would do such a thing as try to make up points by doing their own reviews?I'm just disgusted. Disgusted. And frightened now that we may be illegally further charged as others have been by these crooks. And all with no recourse.Do not do it. Do not stay there. Honestly. There are many many other places to stay for a good price. And SF is a small city you don't have to stay in Nob Hill if it's close to something you wanted to see. Besides just three blocks down from this place is uh let's just say not so nice.My husband and I could overlook the cramped room with uncomfortable temperature. We could overlook the cheezy decor. We could overlook the drunk man who smalled of urine stumbling into the lobby and then falling down the stairs as he couldn't wait for the elevator (even though he never pushed the button) and the staff had nothing to say about him. They just let him on in! We could overlook the hostile woman manning the front desk.We cannot overlook theivery. We cannot overlook lies. We cannot overlook the fact that had we not had police intervention we would have been scammed out of lots of money....all on our very first night in SF.","2013-09-17T11:14:40","153893.0","4","2013-09-17T09:33:40","ZD111559","California","1992-01-01T00:00","90081","5.0"

In a sentence get to this hotel; get to this hotel QUICK before the 'corporate suites' realize what they have and DOUBLE THE RIDICULOUSLY LOW RATES! ... I'm telling you JUST DO IT!ROOMS: The 'regular' rooms (there is nothing 'regular' about them) are GREAT! Clean new modern. meticulous attention to detail and much more. Now if you can step-up for just a little extra and get yourself a room on a Concierge Floor ... DO IT! ... The rooms are the same size as the so-called 'regular' rooms but my goodness the AMENITIES are NON-STOP. In the interest of saving verbiage (most people do not like to read) and to get to what I really want to talk to you about the STAFF the final comment regarding the concierge-floor rooms is YOU WILL NOT WANT FOR ANYTHING! AND YOU WILL NOT WANT TO LEAVE... Step-up and DO IT! They are a bargain!Now for my true purpose the STAFF!These folks these special gifts to us from a Higher Power are listed in no particular order hierarchy or level of importance. Each and everyone of them are special to my wife and I. And each and everyone of them we would be honored and proud to call FRIEND.To respect their right to privacy I have omitted their last names.CATHY - Front Desk Commander in Chief. Oh my goodness! Where do I begin with the adjectives and comments for this beautiful lady CATHY? ... Hmmm how about 18-years of Hospitality Industry professional-experience! All spent with ONE employer. How about her PERSONAL SEARCH from July 2008 to November 2008 (when the hotel opened) in HANDPICKING each and everyone of her TEN Front Desk staff Team members! If their warm and friendly greeting and their infectious smiles don't fill your heart with warmth ... GET YOURSELF SOME PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC HELP. You've been SOUR for far too long and are in dire need of detuning! Cathy found the time from her very busy schedule to chat with us. WHAT A LADY! Thank you CATHY. It's for you your family your employer and the world that we write this. A final comment and Cathy this comment is directed entirely toward you. In spite of the best-foot-forward and the little bit of fluff you shared with us both Fida and I could see the pain and the Love in your eyes. THANK YOU CATHY. You are very special INDEED! RUDINA - Front Desk Associate. You wanna hear special? I took my Fida (pronounced Feedah) for a long 3-day weekend in New York City to celebrate my wife•À_s birthday. We had arrived early and our room was not quite ready (which we expected to happen and fully understood). RUDINA overheard another staff member offer us to leave our luggage and for me to give them my cell-phone number so they could call us when the room was ready. During the course of our conversation the other Associate learned that we were in NY to celebrate Fida's birthday. ... Here's what we discovered ... We get the call we go back to the hotel at our leisure and check in. Go up to our BEAUTIFUL room with a FANTASTIC view and what do we find? ... TWO BEAUTIFULLY BOXED FRESH DELICIOUS CUP CAKES AND A BEAUTIFUL BIRTHDAY CARD FOR FIDA SIGN BY EVERYONE ON DUTY THAT DAY INCLUDING THE CHEF!!!!!! We don't know if this beautiful little girl or another Associate that I will write about further down got permission to leave their post go to a bakery to buy my wife this gift and card and then to have everyone sign it but I know she was in on it. I•À_ll telling you folks honestly this beautiful UNNECESSARY gesture brought tears to both our eyes. ... Now please don't go there and tell these Front Desk Angels it's your birthday and expect these very special people to do this for you. There are thousands of you that will be reading this and it could cost them their position. So please be nice. THANK YOU RUDINA. YOU ARE VERY SPECIAL!LIZ - Head Bartender. Ask Liz to show you her hubby's 'six-pack'. She keeps it in her 3G phone so don't let her tell you she doesn't know what you're talking about. Have a cocktail at her bar and you won't have to go any place else. This DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS young woman OOZES HOSPITALITY. Be careful of two things if you have a drink at 'Liz's Bar' - 1) You'll be late for whatever other engagement you have. You won't want to leave her. 2) Don't tell her boss but LIZ can't measure! LIZ does not know the meaning of a one-ounce measurement. She's like the EverReady battery when mixing a cocktail ... the booze just keeps pouring and pouring! (LOL). In all seriousness (calm down bosses) LIZ is WONDERFUL! Her smile is contagious. Her drinks PERFECT! THANK YOU LIZ! WE APPRECIATE IT AND WE APPRECIATE YOU!DANIEL - Food and Beverage Commander in Chief. A gentleman in every sense of the word. He looks elegant in his meticulous professional appearance. A suit shirt and tie fit for a groom. His 'eye' is unobtrusively on EVERYTHING going on in 'his' restaurant. I even saw him stop on his way to talk to one of his staff and align the breakfast cereal boxes. Now THAT IS ATTENTION TO DETAIL! Thank you DANIEL. You are a credit to your chosen profession. And a credit to your employer. Tell your bosses to watch out. If I ever open a high-end restaurant and you never know Fida and I just might we WILL steal you away to run 'your' restaurant with us not for us. Professionalism like yours cannot be taught. It's in your heart. THANK YOU!VANESSA - Front Desk Associate. On my Gosh! ... Jaw dropping gorgeous! And a personality to match! VANESSA checked us in. It was an overcast morning in NY yet VANESSA•À_S smile brought sunshine into the reception area. After a long trip and hauling luggage what a way to get welcomed. UNBELIEVABLE! THANK YOU VENESSA! THANK YOU! ... And I think she was the one that ran around for Fida. WOW!ERICK - Don't know what his title is. I find the label Bell Hop insulting and I will not call ERICK by that title. I'll say this about him. On his feet countless hours a day. Hauling luggage up and down all day long and yet always finds a way to hold a door for you and greet you with a smile ... EVERY TIME! And one-liner jokes to brighten your day. THANK YOU ERICK. THANK YOU!STEPHANIE - Concierge. Meet STEPHANIE spend time chatting with her and I guarantee you will go to where ever she recommends. That's professional! To meet an expert with so much knowledge that immediately you trust (and do) what they says. THANK YOU STEPHANIE.And lastly the GENERAL MANAGER whose name I am intentionally withholding to protect his anonymity (So he can get his work done and not spend time on frivolous complaints). THIS GM HANDPICKED EACH AND EVERYONE OF HIS DEPARTMENT MANAGERS WHO IN-TURN HANDPICKED EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE STAFF TEAM MEMBERS. That is LEADERSHIP! Something that I thought we had lost in this country. LEADERSHIP! Without it a company any company is nothing! THANK YOU MR. GM. THANK YOU. WOW! WHAT A JOB YOU ARE DOING! AND WOW WHAT A HOTEL!As I said in my intro this review was more about giving the staff of the WINDHAM GARDEN HOTEL the recognition they so richly deserve. Here's my bottom line: I would sleep in a cardboard box and be happy as long as this UNBELIEVABLE staff was there to provide me with the level of professionalism service and genuine caring I thought had been lost in this beautiful county of ours.THANK YOU ALL! If I have forgotten any names PLEASE FORGIVE ME. It's just that there were just so many of you making us feel like family that it was hard to remember all the names. I (we) will make it up to you the next time we visit. AND THERE WILL BE MANY MORE VISITS (God Willing). We have discovered ...

IF you care about the room. We ended up spending time alone in our room -- more than we expected. So next time we'll stay at a prettier hotel. We picked Luxor because we thought it would be cool and while the lobby and the area near the East Tower were kind of neat the rooms were more tacky 80's decor intermingled with marble you know for that Egypian feel... The rooms were clean. They were just dingy and a bit all-around icky. We were upgraded to the East Tower and again while it was not awful I am concerned about the other rooms in the hotel as this in no way felt like an upgrade ;) The walls are very thin too. We learned they do not have good TV channels because we had to sleep with the TV on only so we didn't have to hear other couples around us doing their couple duties if you catch my drift ;)We stayed in the cheap rooms so I can't speak for the fancy ones if they exist but there are no mini-fridges/bars no snackies to be had no coffee maker. We were fine with all of that as we are not only coffee snobs but booze snobs and expected to spend way too much on our drinking luxuries there. Some may find this intolerable. The staff was generally nice and polite. We only had one negative (and miserable!) experience but I am not using it to grade the hotel as a whole like too many people do on their reviews. With this said be sure to eyeball your bill when you check out. We traveled with another couple and a staff member had given them a coupon booklet with 4 free coupons to the buffet More. This apparently was a catastrophic mistake on their part. We ended up using the coupons for one lunch and didn't think anything of it until we saw we were charged for the meal ($71 for 2 people!!) We believe the booklet our friends were given was for some all-inclusive package. I didn't even know they had one and this is all speculation as the staff is so secretive about these coupons that none of us know what to think even still! Anyway 40 minutes of arguing ethics with people who just do not care they comped us. Problem solved. We just felt their management was grossly inappropriate for not owning up to a mistake THEY made. Aside from that one experience the hotel was okay. Decent I dare say but I'd prefer to spend the money and stay somewhere nicer ONLY because we ended up spending more time in the room than we expected.One last thing and I think this applies to all hotels out there but they charge a daily resort fee of $13 (after tax) to give you 2 teeny bottles of water and a bad newspaper every day. So after the airline nickle and dimes you expect your hotel to do the same :)","2013-09-17T13:58:08","143317.0","-4","2013-09-17T10:31:19","ZD111127","California","2015-01-01T00:00","92619","5.0"

First the positives:- fantastic location - peaceful and calm - lovely building with a nice settingOn arrival though most of the rooms were not ready and this was still the case well after the stated check-in time. For example the bride's parents couldn't get into their room until after 4pm (when check-in was supposed to be 2pm).I was lucky and my room was ready at 3pm......or so I thought. When I turned up the room hadn't been cleaned. I was told that it definitely had been cleaned so I had to find someone from housekeeping myself and explain that a bed that had been slept in used towels in the bath and tea and coffee mugs still dirty didn't constitute a cleaned room.The room itself was fine if very basic and a bit tired. However when we tried to use the shower we found it didn't work. We called reception who said this was a known problem with the room (!) and they would send someone to look at it. 10 minutes later and no-one had turned up. I called again and was told that I would just need to be patient and someone was on their way. After the 3rd phone call someone turned up and spent 10 minutes fiddling with the shower. Eventually they got it working (scalding hot). When I enquired why they let people stay in a room without a working shower he said that it wasn't broken - if it was he wouldn't be able to fix it. After 5 mins argument he finally admitted that the shower was faulty and they often had to send people to the room to fix it. I presume often in this case means every day. I didn't get a proper apology - just a token few pounds off the bill after I demanded they tell me what they were going to do about it.If you do have the misfortune to be staying here make sure you aren't in room 111. that way you at least have a fighting chance of being able to get a shower without waiting 45 minutes...","2013-09-17T14:58:05","108706.0","-4","2013-09-17T10:17:04","ZD111466","California","2007-01-01T00:00","91752","5.0"

Some staff are helpful and responsive but most desperately need a crash-course in basic customer relations and can't be bothered with even the most simple requests. I've stayed at this hotel three times due to convenience bookings among several groups of colleagues and we all joke about the poor service. As a Platimum Marriott Rewards member who stays in Marriott hotels around the world on business I'll say that the basics - clean rooms and linens operable phone and Internet security - are all provided here. But apparently the hotel management is depsperate enough to cut costs that they've made that the obvious priority among the staff and it's almost comical. A camera on the honor bar in the concierge lounge? Are you kidding me? Even with that in place they have staff patrolling the lounge distributing honor bar tab tickets to everyone present. And then a manager accosting people as they left a stack of honor bar tickets in his hand. Tiny amounts of food at the buffett are replaced very infrequently during meal times...and all the while you can catch a glimpse of the staff in the prep area standing next to full trays of this food watching the clock while a room of hungry loyal Marriott customers waits (they can use this time to fill out their honor bar tabs I suppose). Are you kidding me Marriott? Simply shut down the concerige lounge if you're losing so much money folks. I'm pretty sure you're defeating the entire purpose with this insulting behavior - and the message your corporate management intends to send to your Elite membership.","2013-09-17T12:18:42","111962.0","-4","2013-09-17T11:46:02","ZD111350","Florida","1969-01-01T00:00","32190","5.0"

The hotel is only three storeys and there are 3 nightclubs for the local population that start from 9pm till 3am (finishes on the dot) EVERY night of the week that play kind of new age-house-bangra (?!) with booming bass that rattles through the whole hotel. We were on the second floor reasonably far away from the disco but the noise travelled all the way through the stairways and corridors and make no mistake its loud (you can even see vibrations in a glass of water on a table in the room dancing along to the beat)! The discos are frequented by the native version of english chavs and you will get strange looks from them as you return to the hotel in the early hours but its perfectly safe as theres loads of bouncers and staff and they are probably just interested in you.The pool area is rubbish a tiny pool virtually in the shade all day as it is overlooked by two three storey neighbouring apartment blocks and smells of whatever the neighbours are cooking that day (it was usually curry). If you run a bath the cold water is always luke warm however long you run it and the hot water is cold to luke warm and brown - we opted for showers with the cold tap!On the positive side of things the hotel itself is clean and tidy and the rooms were nice - similar standard to a UK travelinn for example king sized comfy beds and the staff were always very friendly apart from 1 - a very rude gentleman behind the desk who we assumed was the manager (I dare you to complain to him about the cold hot water). Also as we were in Dubai taking job interviews not a holiday a budget hotel was essential and we coped by going out and having plenty of drinks at night so we more or less passed out regardless of the noise when returning to the hotel. The games room bar has 2 really good quality pool tables shows B4U music and Cricket on a projector screen and the staff keep bringing you free popcorn to munch on.If you are planning on going out every night and staying out late this will be a great budget hotel to stay at as the noise shouldn't affect you too much. Also this is great for big new age bangra music fans. If not I strongly recommend to stay elsewhere.Finally my lasting memory of the hotel will be on the last night lying awake in the bed counting down the minutes till I can get some sleep at 3am laughing to myself as the bouncers were ejecting some local indians as the screams shouts and hindi insults reverberated along the corridors.

Whilst it was great to have spent a few (very cold) days in Montreal for the first time over this past weekend ('09) you do need to know for future reference that the Intercontinental Hotel (Montreal Quebec Canada) was seriously one of the worst hotels we've ever stayed in anywhere. We had serious reservations upfront about staying in 'anything InterContinental' but were happy to overlook them not least of all as it seemed like a good 'easter weekend' deal. They are however in the process of a major renovation which is fine to a degree but not when one isn't warned of this upfront and where virtually (i.e. literally) every service within the establishment suffered accordingly - and made a mockery of their 'weekend special'. The above concerns/ reservations were further confirmed upon entering our 'newly renovated stale-smelling straight out of the early seventies maroon room' - reservations that were re-inforced whenever one needed to for example phone any service within the establishment (a challenge all of it's own) and for instance request towels or that old room-service crockery be removed etc. as happened incidentally each day. I used to be in the hotel biz many years ago so perhaps I tend to notice small things. The trouble was that our numerous not unjustified 'complaints' ranging from room service to housekeeping to not even having someone to assist us with our luggage upon arrival were rather larger service issues. The noticeable lack of any visible senior management merely exacerbated the above service deficiencies despite the friendly attitude and efforts of the long-suffering front house staff working under ridiculous makeshift conditions. Also just for the record it's not truly in the old quarter no matter what is claimed to the contrary.The above was all put in writing at their request upon our departure if I were you however I would seriously hesitate ever recommending this hotel/ group to anyone in the future. Needless to say I have never heard a single word from anyone at the hotel apropos the unnaceptable level of service received.","2013-09-17T12:52:48","101679.0","1","2013-09-17T11:17:32","ZD111490","Illinois","1964-01-01T00:00","60130","5.0"

I recently needed to stay in Las Vegas for business and my staff booked a room at the Tropicana due to it's location to my business. Upon arrival things seemed okay. The staff was friendly efficient and courteous. However when I got to my room things began to slide. The room was so far from the lobby casino I thought I might be crossing into another state. The view from my room was a filthy gutter and a roof complete with conduit and other utilities. And I was not looking down on the roof was above the window like so there was literally nothing else to be seen. The carpet was threadbare. The chair in the room was faded and worn through so that the foam stuffing was coming out. The ceiling was dropped to under the standard 8 feet making the room feel oppressive and cramped and there was rust mildew and general discoloration throughout the bathroom. The towels though clean were so sheer one could hold them up to the ceiling and see light filtering through. The floors in the room and in the hallways to the room were completely uneven and the smell was stale. At night the noise of the thankfully working air conditioner was so loud it sounded as though someone left an Edsel idling in the bathroom. I complained to the desk about this but was informed that they were sorry but there were no more rooms available. Because of a convention in town I was completely booked So I figured since the room was inexpensive and I was only there 2 days I would stick it out which I did. I was in one of the older wings of the hotel and perhaps the tower is nicer but I have to say that I would not stay at this hotel again unless absolutely necessary. I wrote this review simply to spare others the experience I had. If you book this hotel be sure to ask for newer accommodations and avoid the older wings. You'll probably enjoy a better experience than I.","2013-09-17T12:52:11","136692.0","0","2013-09-17T10:12:03","ZD111191","Indiana","1973-01-01T00:00","46033","5.0"

This can sometimes be coloured by how much someone enjoys their holiday.My fiancee girlfriend before we went to New York and I both enjoyed this hotel. The rooms were clean and well equiped. The staff were friendly and the hotel was in a fantasic location. It's near enough to a subway station to allow easy access to the whole of the city but at the same time ideally located to be quiet at night.Central Park is a delight and is worth a day by itself.I would be happy to stay at this hotel again and can't believe there's a hotel like this available at a reasonable price.Great hotel great city...","2013-09-17T13:28:01","120447.0","0","2013-09-17T12:38:58","ZD111216","Minnesota","1969-01-01T00:00","55419","5.0"

Lovely lobby and check in was very smooth. Room was very nice spacious and well-cared for but two things put a bit of a damper on this trip to Vegas. Firstly the smell of the cigarette smoke knocks you over in the casino that you have to walk to in order to get to the elevators that whisk you up to your room and secondly I got a bit of attitude from one of their suited staff members at check out which really threw me back. I had numerous suitcases since I was combining a business and leisure trip to three destinations over a two week period and since I couldn't carry them all I asked an employee who was dressed in a suit rearranging the traffic ropes near the front desk if he could help me by either getting the luggage porter himself or calling someone on the radio or telephone so they could help me. The uninterested response I got was it'll take me at least 10 minutes to do it - it's right over there. I couldn't believe my ears. He actually pointed across the room! I'm not feeble but with a swollen ankle the trip back and forth across the expansive lobby to the front of the hotel was not something I enjoyed or expected I'd have to do. I left the hotel feeling very disappointed.","2013-09-17T11:53:02","143132.0","3","2013-09-17T11:35:38","ZD111204","Mississippi","2002-01-01T00:00","39215","5.0"

So go break a law and have three hots and a cot. You'll at least have Amnesty International on your side.Was booked here for a quick business trip three nights Friday through Sunday by someone in my office unfamiliar with the place.It looked good online. $49 a night over a busy Vegas weekend coffee in rooms continental breakfast central location. In fact the central location was in the hellhole neighborhood between the north end of the Strip and downtown. Very scary and remote wall-to-wall crackheads and tweakers. Nowhere to eat nearby but all the adult bookstores and tattoo parlors you could wish for. There was no coffee neither in the room nor in the lobby and the continental breakfast advertised was closed pending a health inspection. Bed sloped down on the sides only good if you're sleeping alone in the middle. The hot water wasn't and... worst ... the air conditioners were broken so the night temperature hovered in the mid-90•À_s in the rooms. Best I can say is I didn't see any bugs. Oh the old guy at the counter on night duty was really sweet and did try to sort out the air conditioner. He couldn't so he gave me the company-set maximum discount for the lack of cool air in the desert: 15%. That works out to what $7.50? Not his fault though any of it.I checked out one night early after I found the Stratosphere down the street had a room for $30 (this was Sunday night when casino rooms are much less expensive) with ample hot water ice cold air and all the other traditional casino hotel amenities. So I didn't have to fight my way into a jail cell for better accommodations. If you are a single college guy and can't get a room for less anywhere else it's OK but not for anyone with even remotely higher expectations and DEFINITELY not for women traveling alone or anyone with kids.","2013-09-17T15:02:52","113675.0","5","2013-09-17T11:08:44","ZD111370","Mississippi","1991-01-01T00:00","38623","5.0"

My wife and I spent an evening at the SFD to catch a play down the street just off Union Square. We'd had a nice post-theatre meal last year at the hotel restaurant Scala's and thought the hotel would be worth a try. The location is terrific - just off Union Square on the cable car line etc. We'd stayed at another Kimpton property in Boston and were impressed by the hip neo-classic styling in the rooms and the attitude of the place. Well at the Drake the look comes off like an old Hollywood starlet who's now getting by on cat food.  It has a beautiful old turn of the century lobby with some of Kimpton's signature touches - nouveau high-style furnishings etc. - the stylistic elements of which repeat in the rooms per Kimpton's formula. But it comes across as too formulaic here and a band-aid on some real problems. Such as: paper-thin walls between the rooms; sooty windows; poor temperature control throughout the hotel (about 55•À_ in the lobby on the chilly day okay but at their retro rooftop lounge Harry Denton's Starlight Room it was also downright chilly - no budget for say a Home Depot thermostat?). Our bathroom had only a handicapped shower mounted at nose level - necessitating a crouch to get wet (we never requested this type of room and the place was clearly not full). Above the shower stall a hole in the wall covered by a rectangle of white plastic held in place by some old white fabric tape. (!) The hallways were renovated in a half-baked way: hip-ish light fixtures but depressing brown walls beat up doors and a vague rotting smell. We won't be returning soon - the Drake has potential to be a flashy retro hotel experience but Kimpton needs to pump some serious dough into it to make it a liveable place again.","2013-09-17T14:50:33","151714.0","2","2013-09-17T10:07:11","ZD111270","New Jersey","1978-01-01T00:00","7921","5.0"

Whilst it was great to have spent a few (very cold) days in Montreal for the first time over this past weekend ('09) you do need to know for future reference that the Intercontinental Hotel (Montreal Quebec Canada) was seriously one of the worst hotels we've ever stayed in anywhere. We had serious reservations upfront about staying in 'anything InterContinental' but were happy to overlook them not least of all as it seemed like a good 'easter weekend' deal. They are however in the process of a major renovation which is fine to a degree but not when one isn't warned of this upfront and where virtually (i.e. literally) every service within the establishment suffered accordingly - and made a mockery of their 'weekend special'. The above concerns/ reservations were further confirmed upon entering our 'newly renovated stale-smelling straight out of the early seventies maroon room' - reservations that were re-inforced whenever one needed to for example phone any service within the establishment (a challenge all of it's own) and for instance request towels or that old room-service crockery be removed etc. as happened incidentally each day. I used to be in the hotel biz many years ago so perhaps I tend to notice small things. The trouble was that our numerous not unjustified 'complaints' ranging from room service to housekeeping to not even having someone to assist us with our luggage upon arrival were rather larger service issues. The noticeable lack of any visible senior management merely exacerbated the above service deficiencies despite the friendly attitude and efforts of the long-suffering front house staff working under ridiculous makeshift conditions. Also just for the record it's not truly in the old quarter no matter what is claimed to the contrary.The above was all put in writing at their request upon our departure if I were you however I would seriously hesitate ever recommending this hotel/ group to anyone in the future. Needless to say I have never heard a single word from anyone at the hotel apropos the unnaceptable level of service received.","2013-09-17T12:02:14","106254.0","-2","2013-09-17T11:13:21","ZD111423","North Carolina","2010-01-01T00:00","27265","5.0"

Before coming to the Quality Crown I stayed at a number of hotels in London. I have stayed at the Quality Crown on every trip to London since.The staff are completely helpful. I have never encountered one episode of rudeness or unhelpfulness. The rooms 'are' on the small side but this is a central location close to the Paddington Basin buisiness district. Rooms are 'always' going to be at a premium in this area and sometimes you have to sacrifice size for location. That said I was in room 316 the other week which was light and airy with good views over Praed Street.You can take a number of buses from just next door to the hotel that will take you across London. The tube is across the road but you dont hear the noise as the windows are well insulated. There are a number of decent pubs close by. There are restaurants in Paddinton but I'd recommend you take 10/15 minutes to travel a little further afield to places like Bayswater where there is more choice and diversity.Back inside the hotel... There are tea and coffee making facilities (you can have fresh milk at no extra charge) and a complimentary bottle of mineral water. The towels are nice and fluffy and they provide 'Dove' toiletries instead of the usual 'washing up liquid' refills you get in some places.The small gym is well equipped. The executive room is light and airy. The basement bar has a large plasma screen and comfy sofas. Clarification - The Quality Crown do not offer direct catering. Instead vouchers are offered on specific deals for residents to eat at Garfunkles next door. If anyone has an issue with the food then they have an issue with Garfunkels and not the hotel per se. That said I've had some great steaks there which were far superior to the Steak House over the road. The breakfasts are great!I have sat with my colleagues at the small bar near reception (yes... my business colleagues stay there too) and we've watched the staff deal with some very 'challenging' (okay... let's be honest.. 'rude') customers in the most professional of manners. George the concierge rushed to assist and support people who are frail or elderly 'and' refuse a tip! (and I've been in some hotels where it's more than their job's worth). Keep an open mind. This is London. Big is not neccessarily beautiful. Good things often come in small packages. If you want discreet unobtrusive accomodation then this is for you.Great for business travel is you can book the double rooms.","2013-09-17T11:55:04","122469.0","-2","2013-09-17T10:08:03","ZD111217","Ohio","2014-01-01T00:00","43098","5.0"

Our spotlessly clean room was very quiet even though it was only four floors above the main road. It was both spacious and comfortable with a double bed - the biggest we've ever slept in - large enough to easily accommodate two fully grown sumo wrestlers ! The large marble bathroom was well stocked with toiletries towels and bathrobes and didn't suffer from any plumbing noises. All the hotel staff were smartly groomed polite helpful and very efficient - a refreshing change from our three previous New York experiences. Although only a 10 minute stroll to 5th Ave/Grand Central Station/Empire State Building the Kitano is situated in a quiet safe and fairly select residential area. The oriental menus and the green tea bags left in our room didn't do too much for my wife and I but there were plenty of alternative places to eat nearby. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely return. Although the room rates are slightly higher than the average NYC hotel the Kitano is excellent value for money.We decided to stay in this hotel solely based on TripAdvisor comments we're so pleased we did and now hope our assessment may also encourage others to follow. Tips : Bring along your own favourite type of tea bags but leave your umbrella at home - you'll find one hanging in the wardrobe.","2013-09-17T14:57:33","135191.0","-3","2013-09-17T09:34:52","ZD111190","Ohio","1978-01-01T00:00","44621","5.0"

We had dinner at Gallagers and Il Fornaio (sp) and had lunch at America. All were decent. There is some construction going on right in the center of the casino not a big space but it does make you walk around. Hopefully they are adding a nice sit down lounge area.

I was dreading 1/ check-in taking forever 2/ railway noise 3/ nowhere nearby to eat at a weekend 4/ a scrum for a poor breakfast etc. My fears were unfounded. 1/ On arrival at 7.30pm on a Friday the reception was very busy with people checking in and what looked like a school prom. We were attended to immediately and were in our room within ten minutes. As it was nearly bedtime for our small daughter I grabbed a takeaway pizza for DW and me from Pizza Express which is about three minutes walk away. 2/ Our room was right on Fenchurch St. station platform but do you know what we could barely hear the trains the lines mustn't have any joints there because you don't hear any of that clunkety-clunk train noise. You could just hear some of the station announcements but only just. Yes we would have loved to have been lucky and got a view of the Tower but we weren't so the curtains just stayed closed most of the time. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom although a bit on the small side was reasonably equipped with nice toiletries.3/ If you head away from the Tower into the city you will find a lot of the places even little convenience shops closed for the weekend but there's a Wetherspoons pub right across the road for a pint and a bite to eat the aforementioned Pizza Express is close by too. Not fine dining but acceptable reasonably priced grub. On Saturday night we walked to St .Katherine's dock about five minutes away and went to Strada a chain Italian restaurant. All good service food and price. A bottle of wine was about the same as you'd pay at restaurants where I live and the water for the table was bottled filtered tap water FOC. A pleasant surprise in London not to feel your eyes are being taken out. I suppose some may find the area too quiet at night so if you want some kind of massive rave party your probably out of luck round there.4/ We aren't big breakfast eaters and the selection for Continental breakfast was fine. Cereals fresh fruit salad cold meats and cheese bread rolls etc. Fruit juices weren't of good quality but there was enough selection to have a decent start to the day. The coffee was terrible though only barely warm when it didn't need to be. Breakfast room was only about a third full at 8.30 am.We booked this hotel based on price and because it had a pool and a central London location with good access to the tube so we could use that to explore London. It fitted the bill on all these points now if only they could warm their coffee up and upgrade me to an Imperial Super Deluxe Maharajah suite next time!","2013-09-17T11:34:01","118532.0","-4","2013-09-17T09:12:32","ZD111390","Texas","2002-01-01T00:00","78256","5.0"

A mid-town Manhattan hotel across the road from Madison Square Garden and one block away from Macy's is about as good a location as you can get for a New York city break. The down-side to that is you are occupying some very expensive real estate so don't expect 'big'. With that expectation in check our room was a very pleasant surprise. A 'queen' room on the 33 floor at the back of the property yes it was small but perfectly functional. The hotel revels in its Art Deco history and the decor of the room continues this very well. But for the flat screen tv and free WiFi one could imagine yourself back in the 1930s - though I stress that the furnishings are new clean and very comfortable.This is a constantly busy property with a lot of comings and goings and is in the centre of THE major metropolitan area. However we found our entire five night stay to be reasonably peaceful with only the occasional siren penetrating our sleep.

Warning: If you are driving a larger vehicle the manuevers in and out of the parking area may require some ground guides to lend a hand. The pool area was family oriented and not really my cup of tea but if I wanted a quick dip it looked clean and well maintained. I dont know about the bar or the resturant as I was staying in a neighborhood that if not famous for it's food is a least well known by the locals for great eats. Walk 1 block up the hill to Polk street make a right and there are at least 7 or 8 great resturants including one of the Best Thai Houses in the City....and this is a neighborhood that people live in and do their laundry and pick up their dry cleaning and walk their dogs...so sit at the cafe and enjoy. As I said before...the location is perfect for so many things and the area is VERY safe. If you are there to stay in your room then forget it...stay at the Hilton but if you are in San Francisco to see the City...you are in the right place.","2013-09-17T12:04:41","143759.0","3","2013-09-17T09:52:20","ZD111467","Utah","1964-01-01T00:00","84067","5.0"

Grill is excellent and would go back there.Pools - unwelcoming and small so didn't swimMeeting facilities - quite good and well organised but catering averageTaxis - had to wait an hour for a taxi - not really 5* - they should be queing up.If you want a centrally located great hotel then book the ET as in the title the Fairmont was expensive and average in everything except food will not be going back - 1400Dhs for this is possibly the worst value for money I have seen even in Dubai.If you want luxury business then I'd advise the ET which never disappoints and cheap and good business then its the Novatel.Others in my party really liked the hotel so maybe I'm just spoiled but I expect far more for my money.","2013-09-17T14:07:59","155852.0","-4","2013-09-17T09:41:26","ZD111296","Washington","1958-01-01T00:00","99330","5.0"

We normally go west to carribean but could not find a flight for under •À_600. I spotted a flight from our local airport for •À_262  so researched Dubai as an alternative using tripadvisor of course. Choose this Hotel based on reviews percieved value and am so glad that we did!Had a bit of a glitch when trying to e-mail before our late arrival but once that was sortedplain sailing from there on. From arranging transfers to our friendly reception at the hotel perfect.Now I had of course read about the dreaded building noise and on waking I opened the french doors of our room and I could hear the distant rumble and my heart sank..........but then I realised that I could hear far more clearly the birdsongand water noises from the babbling brooks See the wonderful laid out gardens and lovely beach.I can honestly say that I had no issue with the constuction works at all.Now as for the facility we were upgraded  twice without asking. If you want a quiet resort away from the hustle and bustle of downtown this is what you get. Roomssuites perfect bathrooms are glorious setiing idylic. But saying that What makes a five star hotel special?I believe from talking to others that there are indeed much more luxurious hotels in Dubai.The 5 star for me on this trip was the attitude of the many staff. I am an hotelier by profession. The people that served me and my family were very very good. They were happy in their work and this manifested itself with uncontrived joy in their demeanour. Sounds daft but this was the biggest difference for us on this trip.Must also mention the white Orchid. Superb! Tapenyaki a must arrigato Chef you were great!

I don't understand the bad reviews I read on this site before we left. They must be from less experienced travellers because we quite enjoyed our 7 day 8 night stay.We stayed on the 7th floor and it was a quiet room the odd siren or horn could be heard at night but we were never actually awoken by any of this. The bedroom itself was smallish which I expected in NYC but it was comfortable. We had some closet space and a dresser which helped for our week-long stay. The queen bed was comfortable but I'd ask for extra pillows. The bathroom made up for it-big enough for two of us to get ready at once(plus my girlfriend enjoyed not having to pack her hairdryer). We were especially concerned about cleanliness. No worries our room was cleaned everyday and although the staff was not always cheery they were certainly never rude to us. And no there were no bugs or mice.The continental breakfast was simple but good-coffee juices cereal porridge doughnuts bagels and fruit. It was nice to have access to the internet in the hotel as well.The location was fine...a couple of minutes by foot from a subway 5 minutes by foot from the Empire State building and 15-20 minutes by foot to Times Square.We weren't on an extreme budget but the money we saved by staying here allowed us to spend elsewhere. If you aren't wanting to spend loads of time in your room (we were in our room maybe 10-11 hours out of the day-basically just to sleep and unwind) and want a central safe clean location this is the place for you!","2013-09-17T12:07:58","116749.0","-5","2013-09-17T09:37:18","ZD111311","Washington","1948-01-01T00:00","98043","5.0"

It is purely a designer hotel with good value for money when you see the NY rates; best location off Time Square; only 2 min walk to subway.The doormen and beel boys look more like secret service agents and are connected via head phones. Some female receptionists have their own way of communication (NY slang?) but if you see it as part of the whole concept it is fine and can get used to it.The lounge-bar is next to the reception and busy with outside guests on weekend. Great atmosphere; they don't have a menue for drinks so order what you like.Personally I didn't like the breakfast style it is more something for busy travelers; very small choice on the buffet; but eggs etc to be ordered (and paid) extra. But that's the only thing what is better at Crowne Plaza.Room:Either in red yellow or blue fabrics; flat TV with great sound and Bose radio are in the room Molton Brown bath amenities and modern post cards as well as bathrobe but no slippers.Make sure to get the electric Do Not Disturb sign explained. It was on since the previous guest but not recognized. When the maid rings the bell it remains silent and she did not clean the room; had to call in the evening to get it done. Also the outside line was not working but could be fixed after 1 day.Overall I can recommend it to get a new experience in a great &amp; modern atmosphere - but nobody is perfect.","2013-09-17T12:42:15","129349.0","5","2013-09-17T11:17:12","ZD111506","Wisconsin","2011-01-01T00:00","53090","5.0"

This would have to be one of the best value for money hotels in London.I stayed at the Parkcity one night in May for a business meeting. I was meeting a colleague from Toronto and chose this hotel purely because it was rated high in Tripadvisor.com's list yet reasonably priced. I was impressed with the quietness of this hotel located in a residential area. My colleague was impressed and asked me how in the heck I managed to find such a great hotel! I said one word •À_Tripadvisor.com•À_!The only regret I had was not to take a road map on this trip as I took the tube to Earl•À_s Court from the airport and asked for directions to the street in which the hotel was located. I was directed by station staff to the other end of the street which is a long way from Earl•À_s Court station. I found out later I should have walked the other way around (obvious on a map!) which should have only been only about 5 mins from the tube station. Great pubs and restaurant at this location and it•À_s great to be in a area where you can see the locals in their daily activities.The staff at the Parkcity are attentive and very friendly. The bar tender is an Italian fellow (Chalie?) who made the most amazing cocktails. Nice guy too.Almost everything is positive at this hotel although I found the coffee to be of low quality. (But perhaps I should have ordered tea in the UK?). The room and bathroom were both modern and very nice and clean. It was a neat cosy little place and if I were to come back to London for business or pleasure I would definitely be staying at Parkcity again! I highly recommend this hotel for business travelers and couples.","2013-09-17T14:22:26","131803.0","-2","2013-09-17T09:44:54","ZD111539","Arizona","1981-01-01T00:00","85020","5.0"

People either seem to love it or hate it. I am very picky about hotels and my fiance and I had a pretty middle of the road experience. First off we only paid $100 for the room so we weren't expecting too much (especially when other rooms in the strip proximity were going from $295). Yes the lobby is very dark. They must have taken the lobby pictures on their website with truck headlights shining through the doorway. The rooms are dark too which is great for hangovers (the windows are even tinted and don't open very far to let natural light in). I did have to remove the lampshade to put my makeup on by the soft (ha ha) glow of a bare bulb no big deal I just had smokier eyes than usual!Yep there are paintings with nude women in them. Geez they are masterpiece reproductions you prudes. If you are sheltering your children from great works of art I worry for the future. However I would not bring kids here--not because of the art but because it just doesn't feel very family oriented. There are burning candles at low levels in the lobby (interesting touch but not child friendly) and it feels...well...seedy. There are strip clubs across the street and like another reviewer said uncensored porn on the tv. It seems like a hotel more oriented towards STARTING a family. It could have been cleaner. Bring flip flops to wear in the shower and around the room. Then bleach them or pitch them. The carpet seemed grungy the bedspread and throwpillows felt not so fresh and the walls had stains and splatters here and there. I have certainly been in ickier places but the room could have used a sprucing up. I used the previous reviews as a guide so I was just happy that the room didn't need a fire hose. Use common sense--don't put stuff on the floor pull the bedspread back and for God's sake don't touch the bathroom doorknob unless you squirt it with hand sanitizer or cover it with a washcloth. And put the t.v.remote in a clear plastic bag because those things are filthy (I was a health inspector). The previous bad reviews mention an odd smell. Yep--I noticed it too. When we walked into the lobby there was a strong tutti-fruti (like Juicyfruit gum) smell. It was also in the halls and in our room so apparently they had some bizarre smelling hotel freshener. There was an undercurrent of funk but not enough to send me running. It is a $7-10 cab ride to the strip so plan accordingly. If you have a car you will pay $6.50 for valet--no choice. Unless your plans would allow you to park in a strip garage (free) and take a cab to The Artisan. Actually that's a stupid idea you would still have to pay for another cab ride to pick up your car. Oh well---just throwing it out there. All in all our stay was fair. It was what I expected from the previous reviews and I wouldn't stay here again unless the rooms were dirt (ha ha) cheap. It is a good place to stay if you like to hit Vegas running stay up late and sleep all day. We go for the nightlife so we didn't spend a lot of time lounging around this hotel. If you want something shiny and bright and fun and close to everything there are better options. If you are up for an adventure interested in quirky places open-minded willing to overlook some flaws and traveling without children give it a try. Good luck!","2013-09-17T14:22:37","108011.0","1","2013-09-17T12:19:41","ZD111405","California","1968-01-01T00:00","91386","5.0"

We were greeted by a friendly face at the reception checked in (early might I add with no prior notice given) and directed up to our room. We had possibly one of the best placed rooms in the entire hotel on the 36th floor facing directly onto the Empire State Building and looking down onto Madison Square Gardens. The view of the New York City skyline was simply breathe taking. The rooms were small but coming from London where we're very much used to this it really didn't feel unfamiliar. The bathroom was clean and bright and had a fantastic deep Victorian (well it was old) bath to relax in as well as a well functioning over-head shower. The room was cleaned and tidied every day with fresh clean towels giving on each day - something not quite expected from a 3 star hotel.We never actually ate at the Tick Tock Diner (we chose to sample the food further out in the city streets) however it was always very full and looked like it had a pretty cool atmosphere. We did try the stagedoor for breakfast just down the road which was great and was apparently a little cheaper than the Tick Tock.NYC is a phenomenal city and if you're looking for a good clean friendly base to stay while you get exploring The New Yorker Hotel is certainly it.

Overall this was a great hotel. There is a pub at the rear that does good food and everyone is very friendly-plus a 24hr tesco store for those late night snacks too just 2 mins away.

Sumptous yet funky stylish but affordable. A renovated old hotel with lots of personality. The elevator is old and beautiful - but possibly one of the slowest to wait for in Manhattan. I ended up climbing the four flights to my room (small but not as small as the Pickwick Arms) 60% of the time. Dark moody foyer - great if you're coming in a little drunk late at night. It's got an ice machine and they'll happily look after your luggage until you check in or until you need to head off to the airport. Very clean place quiet at the back. The rooms are fairly small and the room keys are cards that unfortunately resemble the phone cards one purchases to make cheap calls. So the first night I woke up in the throes of jetlag went for a leak down the hall in one of the spotlessly clean bathrooms and ended up in my pajamas attempting to get back into my room using my phone card. The guy on the desk obliged me with another one but he was grumpy. But this is New York. Who cares. Great location Hotel 17. Stuyvesant Park is a good sit just nearby. And the East Village is a pleasant stroll away as is Union Square. Price is very cheap for this style of hotel and you really feel good when you walk up the stoop to it.

The doormen open the door and are helpful. The lobby looks fairly impressive and buzzing. Check-in is quick and painless and the lifts are sparkling and modern and thats where all if anything good about this hotel experience ends. ...The word 'experience' becomes no longer apt and 'nightmare' seems more fitting. On arrival to my floor and on exiting the lifts there lies a darker reality. The change from entering this hotel and into the lobby to exiting the lifts and making your way to your room is incomprehensible. The shabbiness of the corridors is immediately noticeable. I began to dread entering my room. The swipe card goes in the door opens and .......Yes on inspection there was torn wallpaper hanging off the walls and yes it was late november and the heating in the room was not working and yes the windows were so badly fitted that a chilling draft could be felt on the floor of the room and yes there was a thin bedsheet provided and oddly no duvet given the climate and yes there were dozens of bathroom tiles that were cracked or missing and yes i could go on about how agedfilthy and poorly maintained the rooms and bathroom were but i'm sure you've got the picture.......What did i learn then? That NO! This isn't the 4 star deluxe rating it gives itself and NO! That nobody should go here under the impression that they will experience anything near 4 star quality. My work finds me staying in different london hotels a couple of times a week and this is the worst hotel i've stayed in for the past 4 years and i've stayed in many. The staff are helpful at first but if you complain about anything their tone changes instantly from caring to uncaring. Quit simply don't stay at this hotel unless your acustomed to the standards of living you'd find in a slum...","2013-09-17T13:40:09","125080.0","0","2013-09-17T11:46:47","ZD111353","Delaware","1992-01-01T00:00","19710","5.0"

I am agreeing with many reviewers' opinions and the only fair way to assess this hotel is to separate its location from the establishment.Let's talk first about the hotel itself: beautiful new building spacious lobby plushy bed tasty breakfast buffet (which was included with my stay) fantastic bath products and shower. I was lucky enough to get a corner room with a view of the PuXi skyscrapers. The YuYuan Renaissance seems to attract more business travelers since I barely saw couples or families during my stay (but instead lots of men in suits). And now for the rub: the location sucks. There's no way around this one. If you prefer to be surrounded by hip boutiques local cafes and cool nightlife...this is definitely not the hotel you should be booking. Yu Yuan is considered Old Town Shanghai and is basically a tourist trap. If you like to visit cheesy Chinese tchachki stores and sample local snacks shops there are literally hundreds of them around the Renaissance. Oh and all the gripe about the subway construction in front of the hotel is true -- let's just say that my cab driver couldn't even drop me off the hotel front door one day due to construction. He had to pull over a block away and I trekked through the flooded street back to the hotel front door. Ugh. So if you find a great room deal through a travel Web site and don't mind the various inconveniences every reviewer has mentioned...go for it. Otherwise try to avoid this hotel until the construction is finally finished.","2013-09-17T12:36:02","141114.0","-4","2013-09-17T09:43:49","ZD111286","Florida","1975-01-01T00:00","32230","5.0"

First room we were given was on the 27th floor on the East Side and it absolutely stank of cigarettes (reception stated they do not specify smoking or non smoking). Room was very dated. For anybody that doesnt know there is another building being built next to this hotel on the east side of the tower and its height is currently around the 25th floor of this hotel meaning lots of workmen noise from the early hours and throughout the day. Due to these problems we asked for change and we got a new room for the second night on the 37th floor on the other side of the building. On this side of the building the views were fantastic especially at night. The room was alot better than our first one although still dated. The hotel food is expensive like everything else in New York so we didnt eat here. This could be a great hotel if it had an internal revamp. Location is good near Grand Central although its a bit of a walk to other subways. From the hotel you can walk within reasonable distance to the Chrysler Building Empire State Central Park and Times Square.Overall not a bad hotel however a few problems as above.","2013-09-17T14:14:39","120760.0","3","2013-09-17T12:38:59","ZD111292","Florida","1995-01-01T00:00","33148","5.0"

What a mistake that was! On the last day of my visit to Montreal I left the hotel at 11:00 a.m. and returned to the hotel around 4:00 p.m. To my shock as I opened the door to my room no one from housekeeping did any cleaning. I was tired and wanted to begin packing for the trip home in the morning. Instead I went down to the front desk to inform the staff that my room had not been made up. The clerk told me that •À_I had to inform them in the morning that I wanted my room made up.•À_ I was very puzzled and I told them I had never heard of such a thing. He again reiterated the same statement and said that they ask this of all their guests! Finally at 7:00 p.m. I came back to a made up room. There is no excuse for this situation. After leaving a decent tip and a thank you note to housekeeping prior to this situation it is evident management is flawed and seriously lacking in the housekeeping department. Since when is it the guests duty to police housekeeping at any hotel and have to follow behind the cleaning staff to see that they are doing their job? It should not be a guests duty to •À_inform•À_ the front desk that they want their room made up every day. Tourists have better things to do than hang around the hotel and see to it that things are done promptly. We are paying for that service. We shouldn•À_t have to supervise it.

When I checked out in the morning the lady at the front desk asked me how I enjoyed my stay and I told her of my dissatisfaction and she like the man at the desk the previous day told me the same thing! No apologies and no compensation at all mentioned except that they would speak with housekeeping. Big deal! If this is the kind of training the staff at the front desk receives forget it.

We had high expectations based on all of the postings on TripAdvisor and I am sorry to say that not a single one of them were met.It is true that we did not encounter any real problems at the JW however we were discouraged by the following:- no one from the staff or management acknowledged the special occasion we were celebrating which I had noted on the reservation. The other hotels we stayed at on the trip offered room upgrades coupons for special services or even just a simple congratulations.- room was small strangely shaped and had lots of wasted space poor view and ventilation and a non-functioning air conditioner.- yes the bathroom was huge with many modern amenities but what's with the flimy sliding door?- staff entering rooms offered a quick knock before entering instead of giving you an opportunity to actually respond.- there is no pastry cart coffee shop or gift shop in the hotel -- simply a high-end restaurant that didn't look like any place we needed to eat.-strange 1-cup coffee maker.-outrageous $47 parking fee.- boring and dated art-deco decor.- younger and inexperienced staff members.

I found it to be basic but ok. Then again if you think of how much you pay there it is quite a rip-off. In Europe I would say this hotel is ok if you pay not more than 80 EUR a night for a room. Sure everything is a bit old there and some parts more run down than others but that is because their furniture is often made from wood and uses carpets where more modern hotels go with more practical furbishing. However staff was quite friendly room service quick and they have a nice outside pool and spa. Also the adjunct restaurants seemed to be alright. But like I said everything there is just 'alright' which is not good enough for ca. 250 EUR a night. I would probably go there again if my work sent me there but I would definitely not recommend this as a honeymoon location.

We arrived at the hotel to be told that we had missed our check in as they had the booking as the 12th. Luckily we booked on line and had the paperwork stating the 13th. Eventually after it was established that the morning staff had alleviated their boredom by rearranging computer bookings the matter was sorted. The receptionist humbly apologised for the mix up and told us that although check in was not until 3pm she would let us go up thirty minutes early....for a fee of •À_20! We declined and spent the following 30 minutes cluttering up the tiny lobby whilst checking out the empty soda machine the unplugged coffee machine and the silent and unproductive air conditioning unit.After sitting for 15 minutes we asked if we could use the toilets...the reply ensued thus:Receptionist: No sorry I can•À_t allow you to because you haven•À_t checked in. Us: Checked in? You mean because we haven•À_t paid the fee you wanted.Receptionist: That•À_s right. If you are not checked in then they are for staff use only.Us: But its only fifteen minutes to go.Receptionist: You are not insured to use our toilet because you are not checked in. Us: I see. So I pay you •À_20 for an extra fifteen minutes usage of the room then I become insured to use the toilet?Receptionist: You could use the ones at the petrol station across the forecourt; they will let you use theirs.Us: Am I insured to use theirs?Receptionist: I don•À_t know.You had to be there•À_Ok the rooms. Furnished in typical Travel Lodge style basic with a few added extras (one miniature soap two disposable cups and a Durex wrapper) we found the bed fresh and clean although we were provided with two wafer thin pillows and a hand and bath towel in a double room. We did ask for extras and waited in reception whilst they rummaged around in the back room for more. But the bathrail had been ripped off and the ceiling and grout were mouldy all little things that were not down to bad housekeeping but to poor building maintenance. The staff were pleasant enough except for the lady we had spoken to on our arrival who peered silently at us over the desk every time we entered the foyer. In the early hours of the first night we suffered a domestic between lovers (oh yes we knew what they were up to•À_) filtering down the corridors and on the second we were entertained by the loud comings and goings of a large party further down the corridor. It would have been even more entertaining had the heated and riotous behaviour been in English but you cant win everytime.Overall it was a place to rest a head but disappointing and derelict.

Four days everything seemed good even very good:The hotel Lobby looks great the hotel and the room looked very clean. Check-In was quick. As New York was almost sold out that days the prices were very good compared to other places. Ok the room is really small probably to small to be comfortable for two but for me it was ok. Nice looking to including the bathroom.Breakfeast in the hotel was not my choice but complementary coffee with complimentary New York Times and a pickup breakfeast from the near neighborhood was ok! There was also a WiFi coverage for free in my room but certainly not a planned and reliable service.So I really enjoyed the first four days of my stay there. The hotel is near Empire State Building 10 minutes walk from Penn and Grand Central 15-20 from Times Square.Last evening the first cockroach appeared. Not a small one but I won the battle! I found an additional one dead near the a/c - where they might come in the room from the very dirty outside backyard. I did not ask for a roomchange or even did not complain as I was to tired to rise my bloodpressure. Next day I checked my personal belonings very carefully for blind passengers and left with no good feeling.Without that beasts I would have definetly recommended the hotel to everyone.

We were a bit worried having read some of the negative reviews particularly since we had some problems with our booking already (not the hotel's fault but the company with which we booked.)We were welcomed in a friendly and professional way by the reception staff and quickly settled into our suite which matched the hotel's description well. As others have commented the style of the whole hotel is '1940's / traditional' and this may not be to everyone's taste - but I found it restful in the frenetic atmosphere of central Manhattan.All the staff with whom we had contact continued this positive  initial impression. Carmen Garcia in particular took over and resolved the problems caused by the E-booking company (hint hint - Boo Hiss). We didn't eat in the hotel.

First where were the washcloths? None in the room none at the spa. I could've used one to scrub away the stench of smoke from the adjacent Rampart Casino (REALLY smokey even for a casino). Second in the gym at the spa there are no mirrors in the workout area which makes weight-lifting a little more difficult. Also the spa facilities which are nice enough don't compare with the spas at Mandalay Bay or the Bellagio.The room at the JW was great. It was more than large enough to accomodate the rollaway we requested which was delivered promptly and politely. The queen beds were very comfortable - some of the best hotel beds comparable to Westin's heavenly bed and better than the beds at The Bellagio Venetian MGM et al. The mattress was the perfect firmness and the duvet and pillows were fluffy and comfortable. The bathroom was out of this world. In a city with numerous hotels boasting grand bathrooms this one trumps them all. The jacuzzi tub easily accommodated two people and the rainfall shower was very relaxing. Double-sinks and a separate room for the toilet made sharing the bathroom with four other people a little easier. Also the faux balcony was a nice added bonus to an already terrific room. The whole room felt newly refurbished and showed no signs of wear and the decor was understated and inviting.The pool area was easily accessed from the Spa Tower (where our room was located) and we were not forced to walk through the casino or a shopping promenade in our bathing suits. There were enough lounges for anyone who wanted one and poolside food and drink service was friendly (not prompt though our waitness apologized numerous times for the kitchen being backed up and she did not get flustered when it took us a long time to order because some of us were on the other side of the pool). The pool water was unusually salty but was cool and refreshing nonetheless.All in all it was a very nice trip. The hotel is VERY calm and quiet - seemingly the antithesis of Las Vegas. We utilized the shuttle service a few times but it would've been better if they had one later shuttle returning to the hotel at least on weekends (11:30pm is the latest returning shuttle). Getting to and from the strip was not a problem though a bit more action and better people-watching within walking distance (much better eye-candy at Mandalay Bellagio Hard Rock) would've been nice. Still for the service room and pool I highly recommend this hotel to others.","2013-09-17T11:20:54","114477.0","-2","2013-09-17T10:30:59","ZD111523","New York","1991-01-01T00:00","11695","5.0"

Hazlitt's was originally built in 1718 but I was surprised by just how authentic it was. It hasn't been gutted to make way for modernity but at the same time it has all the facilities you need (shower bath tv internet access) without these appearing obtrusive or out of place. The hotel boasts incredible character and Jane Austen fans will immediately imagine themselves as one of her heroines come to town for the winter. The hotel would not look the least bit out of place in any period drama.The building is very cosy furnished with beautiful antiques and poses a pleasant contrast to the modern buzz of the area around it. Some rooms have four-poster beds and although the room I stayed in was simpler it was still completely authentic and very comfortable. I particularly liked the window seats where you could happily curl up and watch the world go by on the street below.The staff are very friendly and happy to advise guests on where to go and what to see. Breakfast is served in your room (from about 7-10 a.m order by placing a card on your door the night before). I can heartily recommend the continental breakfast - warm freshly baked pastries &amp; rolls served with hot tea. The only problem with it is that it was such a comedown to return to my lowly fare of cereal in the mornings!Hazlitt's is very centrally located (Frith StSoho) and easy to reach on the tube (from Tottenham Court Road) and it is but a short and pleasant walk to many of the main sights. All in all I had a wonderful stay. A weekend in Hazlitt's is so much more enjoyable than taking one of the cloned hotel rooms that are the mainstay of city accomodation nowadays. It's the kind of place that encourages you to stay and savour the hotel itself rather than just using it as a place to come back to to sleep. It is expensive but a stay there is an experience in and of itself and one you'll remember.","2013-09-17T12:41:12","158705.0","-3","2013-09-17T11:24:02","ZD111414","North Carolina","1959-01-01T00:00","28006","5.0"

Be sure to ask for one of the rooms on the top floor overlooking Grosvenor Square. They offered this as an upgrade after we expressed dissatisfaction with our first room (which was noisy carpet stained and had a panoramic view of a filthy rooftop). The upgrade included a room that was humid and musty with peeling wallpaper that was visibly streaked with black mold. We're quite certain this room was the cat's meow a hundred and fifty years ago but today it is in desperate need of a wrecking ball and a new roof. Needless to say we did not keep the room and had to move again but both of us got sick from our brief exposure to the mold and we ended up spending almost an entire day in a London clinic. The third room was passable but still a big letdown nothing like the photos. Unable to find another room for the duration of our stay we resigned ourselves to staying in our room as little as possible.

We recently stayed there for one night at the start of a holiday and then four nights at the end. The first night we were in room 2507 on the top floor under the air conditioning system! A fabulous view towards the financial district did not wholly compensate for the noise level.Our twin room was in the American way funished with two double beds. While this worked in other hotels we stayed at on our trip it meant that in the small rooms that this hotel possess it was difficult to open store and manoeuvre around two farly large suitcases. Our four nights were spent in room 807. There was still a noise problem from both within (an air conditioning duct runs down the inside wall of the '07' rooms) and without. I think that the bedroom windows should have been triple glazed which would not have added a great deal to the cost of this recently opened hotel.As other reviewers have noted lifts can be an issue. On our last morning one had broken down a seemingly not uncommon occurrance and it took my partner about 20 minutes to get down to the lobby with her case - she only managed that by getting in the lift while it was on the way up!On the plus side the hotel is within walking distance of many major tourist attractions and three subway lines. The rooms were clean and reasonably well appointed. The reception staff were as helpful as they could be given the chaos that sometimes reigns when a coach party are squeezing into the small lobby. I'd stay there again but I would be choosey about the room I'd accept.","2013-09-17T13:15:36","141141.0","-5","2013-09-17T12:08:51","ZD111315","Tennessee","1949-01-01T00:00","38109","5.0"

According to mapquest it's nearly 6 miles to the next major casino going north (Mandalay Bay). That wasn't a major show stopper though as South Point has everything that you need for a great stay even if you don't leave the hotel. The line for check-in was a little long but a manager came out with a case of cold water bottles that he handed out to everyone in line. A very nice touch I thought. And the line moved fast so I couldn't complain. As others have mentioned use the coupon book that they give you upon checking-in. My wife signed up for their players club and they gave her $25 of slot play which she turned into $35 cash in her pocket which almost paid for the buffet for all three of us. I thought the buffet was quite good better than the ones at Excalibur Circus Circus and Sahara which I have all tried recently. And at only $15.95 and a free bottle of wine (with a coupon from the book) it was quite a bargain. The room was spacious and well-appointed with 50 plasma HD sets mounted on the wall. Didn't have HD channels though as others have pointed out. Bathrooms are large with a separate tub/shower room.We tried out the pool and even though it was July 4th I didn't think it was over-crowded.

You can pay these prices more centrally and get a much bigger and better room with aircon.","2013-09-17T14:20:42","120095.0","5","2013-09-17T10:47:47","ZD111552","Texas","1964-01-01T00:00","77257","5.0"

My husband and I stayed at Caring Hotel for 4 nights in room 15 (superior ensuite; double with private bathroom) and I've listed below the Pros/Cons:PROS: Clean Affordable (•À_72/night thru Venere with 4% disc) near Paddington tube/train station for Heathrow Connect (10-15mins walk) near the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations (former is slightly closer) friendly/helpful staff and decent size room (for London) and our bathroom was newly renovated.CONS: the walls are thin (we could hear our neighbours in room 14 when they were having talking...and they weren't yelling/shouting...we could even hear when they shut their curtains!!! We didn't feel comfortable talking after 11pm so had to whisper so we didn't bother/wake up our neighbours. Also can hear other guests when walking down the stairs in the hallway) and the bathroom was not meant for anyone over 6ft. My husband had to duck each time he had to go thru the bathroom doorway and had to hunch over when taking a shower. I'm barely over 5ft and I was able to easily touch the ceiling when I was taking a shower (palms in full contact)! Having said this we didn't ask for another room my husband was too lazy to change our room and was willing to suck it up for 4 nights.We lucked out that our room was ready for us when we got there at 9am so managed to check-in right away (instead of having to store our luggage and later coming back to check-in at 11am)!I can't really comment on the breakfast as we only went down once and there wasn't much food left (at the time we didn't realize that they were closing; we were 10mins late) but the staff didn't say anything and still served us. Much appreciated! :o) I also can't comment on WIFI since we didn't bring our laptop with us.When we were there it was pretty cold (14 - 18•À_C) so kept the windows closed. I noticed there weren't any window screens so I don't know how it would be in the summer time if any mosquitoes would come in with the windows open (since the hotel doesn't have any AC)?? This may not be an important factor for most people but after I stayed in a hotel in Florence Italy with no AC and no window screens and woke up with 20mosquito bites the next morning this is a huge consideration for me!Overall we would still recommend this hotel to friends and family but would advise them about the thin walls and ceiling height.","2013-09-17T12:15:22","101510.0","-1","2013-09-17T10:35:16","ZD111470","Texas","1988-01-01T00:00","78565","5.0"

Now I don't want to totally write off this hotel but when I stayed there last month they did seem to have a bit of a cockroach problem. In both my room and my colleague•À_s room three floors up we found a cockroach or two (I managed to catch and photograph one but we all know what a roach looks like so I won't inflict it on you). To be fair on the management we complained and they wrote us a letter saying that we could move rooms and they'd get pest control in right away and gave us each a bottle of wine (but no bottle opener!). Still it freaked me out a little bit you don't really expect cockroaches in this climate.Apart from that I'd say that for a hotel in this price range in central London it's adequate. Location is fine just two minutes from Earls Court Tube.

(1 couple in one room and 3 singles in another. The couple got 'upgraded' to a superior room whilst we 3 had a triple room in the West wing. Well the west wing rooms left a lot to be desired. Our room in the west wing was in bad condition with peeling wall paper well worn furniture and carpet which badly need to be replaced. The whole wing was in desperate need of refurbishment to bring it up to a 3 star standard. The bathroom was old yet clean though water pressure was poor. It was a big contrast our friends (the couple) who were upgraded to a 'superior' room. Their room was what one would normally expect as a 'standard room' in a 4 star hotel- definitely not of superior standard. It was what you would expect of a NOVOTEL hotel room. Whereas our triple room in the west wing left a lot to be desired- I•À_m surprised NOVOTEL are not embarrassed at the condition of the rooms in this wing- it is not what you would expect of a NOVOTEL and am surprised at the lack of consistency as usually when you go to a NOVOTEL hotel you know what level of standards to expect","2013-09-17T12:59:49","138634.0","-4","2013-09-17T10:13:56","ZD111411","Alabama","2003-01-01T00:00","36542","5.0"

Information is:Foubert's Hotel2 Turnham Green TerraceLondon W4 1QP[--][--]The hotel has recently remodeled and moved its primary entrance around the corner. It was previously at 162-166 Chiswick High Road.)Foubert's hotel was a lucky find for us located in the heart of Chiswick near family we were visiting. The nearest chain hotels to this area are in Hammersmith which is a reasonably inconvenient distance away. With the exchange rate most London chain hotels are terribly expensive for Americans at the moment so Foubert's rate of •À_69 for a queen size room including breakfast was a great find!The hotel was recently remodeled and significantly downsized. They sold off the building next door on Chiswick High Street so there are now only 6 rooms in the hotel. They're laid out as 2 rooms per floor with one bathroom shared between each 2 connected by a private hallway. There was nobody staying in the other room on our floor so we had the bathroom to ourselves.One note: Since the original hotel desk was in the building that they sold off they're doing room check-in for now at the Cafe counter. That's a little confusing and it took us awhile to figure it out since the doorway labeled for the hotel is locked and nobody answers it if you knock. You check in with the staff located in the cafe area and your keyring will include a key for the hotel door which leads directly to the hallway &amp; stairs going to the rooms.CLEANLINESS:The room was meticulously cleaned and straightened every day by the staff. If anything they were perhaps too diligent about cleaning and sanitizing the bathroom. The smell of cleaning products in the bathroom when we first arrived and mid-day each day was almost overpowering. But at least we knew it was sanitary!ROOM:The room had a typical European queen sized bed and was a bit hard but generally comfortable. They provided an assortment of down and synthetic pillows and several layers of blankets for the bed. The room's window was a bit drafty if the curtains were open and we overlooked an alleyway behind several pubs on the High Street so Saturday night was a bit loud until about 2 AM. Otherwise we slept fine. The room had an alarm clock and several chairs and was generally modest but spacious.FOOD:The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast in the cafe downstairs at street level. They had a menu of items changed daily but it was generally standard European breakfast fare. Toast and eggs croissant with marmalade etc... In the afternoons and evenings the cafe's Gelateria is also open with a sizeable variety of Italian Gelato to choose from.Locally there are a number of restaurants within easy walking distance and several that are open until very late -- 5 AM in some cases. The Indian restaurant on the High Street and the Lebanese take-away restaurant on Turnham Green Terrace were both excellent!TRANSPORTATION:This is perhaps the best part of this hotel's location! They're about 200 yards from the Turnham Green underground station served by the District Line at all times and the Piccadilly Line during early morning and late evening hours. There's also about 6 major bus routes that run down the High Street so rapid access to just about anywhere on the west side of London is no problem. Access to Heathrow Airport and Kew Gardens is especially easy.PARKING:None to speak of... Take public transportation if you can because you'll be fighting for street parking with the rest of London otherwise.Overall this was a pleasant surprise for an independent budget hotel in London. Don't expect luxury or the personal attention of a dedicated B&amp;B but if all you need is a clean and comfortable place to stay a decent breakfast and a very reasonable rate then Foubert's is worthy of consideration.","2013-09-17T12:02:55","129635.0","0","2013-09-17T09:19:42","ZD111392","Alabama","1955-01-01T00:00","35503","5.0"

When I lived in NY I used to come 2-3 times a year to see live theatre and visit favorite restaurants.During these trips I have stayed in many many hotels from 5 Star properties to Bed-and-Breakfasts.I•À_ve read many reviews of this property and in large part those who have had negative things to say are too critical given the value of this hotel if you can get it through an internet site like Hotwire Priceline etc.I only have 2 issues with the hotel--1) No in-room safes. There is a safe the front desk but with a laptop accessories and a passport I always prefer a private in-room safe.2) The relative lack of quick and first-hand knowledge of the front desk about the best transportation options to/from the hotel other than the obvious. (More about this later in the review).My first impression of the hotel was good. On a lively street with a bus stop literally at the front door (#28 &amp; #391). North End Road has a myriad of shops pubs and restaurants between the Tube Station (West Kensington) and the hotel. Within 1 block of the hotel is a Chinese to-go Indian to-go and Fish-and-Chips to-go. Across the street is a Dry Cleaner &amp; Laundry and a few doors down is a 24 hour market (7-11 type).At night I would have no problem whatsoever in walking to/from transportation in this area but with a bus-stop at the Tube and another at the front door walking is optional from the Tube station (about 12 U.S. size blocks).The lobby of the hotel is modern and spotless. The room comes with a continental breakfast which consisted of Apple/Fruit/Orange Juice 4 types of Cereal 3 types of cheese grapefruit sections peaches (canned) yogurt croissants (regular &amp; chocolate) Danish (2 types) white &amp; wheat breads 2 types of muffins (blueberry &amp; chocolate) Regular &amp; low-fat milk and a coffee machine that I would love to take home making Cappuccino Espresso and regular coffees. Many varieties of tea and butter margarine and jams round out the lot.The room was modern and normal size for London hotels of this nature but if you are expecting large resort-style rooms like Orlando you•À_re headed for disappointment.The room was spotless. It contained a double bed a pull out couch a desk TV Coffee-and-tea maker and a small bathroom. The bathroom had a walk-in shower instead of a tub. GREAT water pressure. As far as furnishings I would liken it to Hotel-style Ikea. Lots of laminates and designed to be very specific in it•À_s use and it•À_s use of space. A/C was cold. Actually had to warm it up which for me is extremely rare!Front desk service was always with a smile and they responded favorably to requests although I did have to make a second call for pillows.GETTING THERE: In London there are many ways to get around the most-expensive being Taxis and Car Services.From Gatwick: Take the train headed to Victoria Station but get off at WEST BROMPTON. Frpm there you can walk or take the #190 bus to Lillie St &amp; North End Road intersection. Walk 3 blocks to hotel.From Heathrow: Start with the Tube (Subway to Canadians &amp; Americans). There is only 1 line at Heathrow The Piccadilly Line. Here is the best 2 options•À_1) If you have luggage and want to avoid steps sit in the last 2 cars of the train and get off at HAMMERSMITH. In front of you will be an elevator up. Exit the station and follow the signs for Bus Stop •À_E•À_•À_the walk is short and ALL indoors. There are escalators and an elevator to the bus stop. Take bus #391-Fulham and it takes you to the front door of the hotel.2) Get off at HAMMERSMITH cross the platform and take whatever the next train is. This is the District Line and get off at West Kensington (2 stops-No Elevators in station). At the top of the street you can catch the #391 or the #28 right to the front door of the hotel. OR if you prefer walk it but it•À_s about the equivalent of 12 blocks.NOTE-From Hammersmith you can also take the #190 bus to the Lillie St. Stop (at the intersection of North End Road) but this will require about a 3 block walk whereas the #391 takes you literally to the front door.You should also be aware that the hotel has a contract car service. If you book through the hotel they will tell you the price upfront but understand that this will likely be higher than a metered black Taxi. Stick with the buses and subways (Tube) if you can. It•À_s more efficient and less costly.I spoke with the manager and she promises at my suggestion to produce a mass-transit guide for guests including late night options to get back to the hotel for you partiers and theatregoers.For the money this hotel was worth every penny.","2013-09-17T11:20:33","132378.0","-5","2013-09-17T09:02:49","ZD111423","Arizona","1964-01-01T00:00","85207","5.0"

This hotel seemed like the best deal out of all the other packages that I looked at on Expedia and the location was the best for our needs as well. It is close (5-10min walk) to TImes Square AND Central Park it's right by the theatre district there's a subway stop right beside the hotel there are restaurants galore within a 2 minute walk it was perfect for us. As soon as we got there we did notice that the scaffolding on the outside was still there but it really didn't obstruct our view of the hotel and if anything it was nice because it provided some cover from the rain while we were there. The lobby is bright air-conditioned and clean and no matter what time of day we came and went it was never crowded. We arrived just after 4pm and there were a few people ahead of us checking in but we didn't wait more than a minute or two before they opened up another desk to help us. I had booked a Superior room with a King size bed through Expedia because the room with the double beds was going to be an extra $150. I asked if they had any rooms with double beds available and was upgraded at no extra cost with no hassles. Everyone greeted me by name and they were extremely friendly and helpful.Now the elevators they are a major pain in the butt until you figure out how to work them. There are two bays of elevators at opposite ends of the lobby one serves the lower floors and the other is for the higher floors. You have to select your floor from the touchpad at ground level and the computer will dispatch an elevator to you. HOWEVER that elevator is not necessarily going to be the fastest one. You CANNOT hop into the next available elevator and press the buttons from inside because it will NOT work. You MUST summon the elevator using the touchpad. It is annoying and very slow but it's better than taking the stairs (which you can't even do because the door is locked at ground level). The room itself was beautiful. Standard size for hotel rooms and quite large for your typical NY hotel room. We had a large flat screen tv in the room with HD cable. There were no large bath towels in our room when we arrived but someone came by to check to see how we settled in and they sent up some towels for us immediately. The AC in our room only had one temperature setting - COLD. We turned it off before going to dinner so it was pleasant by the time we went to bed. Not a big deal it's better than no AC at all. The beds were comfortable rooms were kept VERY clean. There was always hot water no matter what time of day we showered which was nice. The drain in the tub was a little sluggish. The water was definitely hottest in the mornings though.The blackout curtains in the room were great to keep out the morning sun for the days when we wanted to sleep in. The room was also amazingly quiet for being on the 4th floor. We didn't have a great view (we could see Hooters and the parking lot next door that's about it) but who wants to sit in their room and stare out their window all day? We used our in-room safe for our valuables it is available free of charge. They also have more safes down at the front desk. The safe did get stuck once inexplicably and security was a little slow getting back to us but they had it fixed in no time. They were very friendly and apologetic.INTERNET well that was a royal pain. It is very expensive ($14.04/day). You can choose between LAN or wireless internet neither of which are very fast or reliable. I wouldn't recommend paying for the internet trust me it's not worth it. You'll spend half your time hitting refresh and the other half the time screaming at your laptop. There is a business centre available if you need to print or fax anything but internet there is $0.30/minute with a minimum charge of $5 and printing/copying/faxing is $1/sheet. Not worth it!I didn't use the gym but my brother did he said it wasn't half bad for a hotel gym had a few treadmills elliptical weight machine bike etc. Lastly our package was supposed to include the buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant. I believe it was called the Park Cafe? It is right in the lobby. Not very big so would be very slow at peak times but it opens at 6:30am and goes until 11. We only ate there once but the food was quite good. Service is slowwww but it was free so whatever! They did charge the meal to our room ($61!) but when I checked out they reversed the charges for us with a smile and a big apology. Speaking of check-out in order to speed up the process they slip a copy of your invoice under your door the morning of your check-out and if everything is in order you can actually check out using your television. In the menu there is a guest-services link and if you follow the prompts not only can you check on the status of your account throughout your stay you can quickly and efficiently check out from the comfort of your own room.All in all the positives outweighed the little negatives and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay while visiting NYC. Make sure you visit the Carnegie Deli right next door for the best deli sandwiches and cheesecake in the world! Just don't go at peak hours or you'll be waiting in a line that goes all the way down 7th Ave. It's open from 6:30am-4am daily.","2013-09-17T13:26:34","135860.0","-5","2013-09-17T09:49:53","ZD111154","Arkansas","1955-01-01T00:00","72716","5.0"

It is very hard to find a hotel at late notice in London therefore I was hoping that this The Bluebell would be a good one so that I could send more business their way. To my great shock and dissapointment he came to work this morning very tired having had only four hours sleep. Why was this? Because it has train tracks running above it and it is old and smelly with bad service. A true sign of the mixed reviews that you can get sometimes.

Flawless check in. The porter (Tony) was the consummate professional offering to pay the taxi for me when the cab had misplaced my fare. Accomodations: Basic single room befitting a single traveller who came to London to see the sights. The room was clean and functional. VERY nice bathroom with walk-in shower. I agree with earlier reviewers that the hotel in general was beginning to show its wear especially noticed in the halls.Dining: I sampled everything from the Savoy Grill to In-Room Dining to the Thames Foyer (for both breakfast and tea) and the American Bar. Impressive all the way around. The tea in particular was excellent and blew away the Ritz; Savoy Grill is a solid one-star Michelin.Location: London is big enough that I don't know if there is a hotel in a perfect location but I was within walking distance of many of the theaters (Vaudeville Savoy Adelphi) and the Opera. Charing Cross is the nearest Underground station.Service: Impressive all the way through with some missteps. Turn down service was missed on two of the 11 nights and room service entered a couple of times without notice. The concierge services were notable (reservations at The Square on a moments notice). Tony the porter/bellboy was again very gracious the master of casual conversation when necessary and professionalism when required.Cost: Appropriate for the overall experience.Summary: I look forward to visiting again in the years to come. The hotel was definitely due for refurbishment and I hope many of the staff return.","2013-09-17T15:03:19","121924.0","0","2013-09-17T11:46:23","ZD111531","California","1974-01-01T00:00","95125","5.0"

The rooms we were in (and we saw two of them which we will explain as you read on) were clean comfortable and what I expected when staying in London. The location of the hotel is what sold me because of its easy acces to Paddington Station which is less than a 5 minute walk and Lancaster Gate Underground which is less than a 3 minute walk.We returned from the Royal Park Hotel from my honeymoon and stayed in room 301 (see room key picture for proof). We were there Sept. 19-25. We got to the hotel early around 10 am. I didn't know that check in was at 3 pm so the concierge who was on duty that morning whose name is Ali (this guy rocks) let us into a room to freshen up. I think he got in trouble for it because they had to clean the room afterward. We were more than willing to wait in the lobby for our room. It was our fault for coming early. So plan ahead and remember check in at the Royal Park Hotel is at 3 pm. Don't expect them to help you out like they did for us. On the way up the elevator Ali mentioned that we should ask for the complimentary sherry or whiskey when we check in. Ask for the complimentary things you shouldn't have to but ask anyway -- you paid for it! We were only in the room for a few minutes but when we decided on leaving our bags downstairs to get familar with the area around the hotel in daylight the staff was more than willing to keep our bags in a locked room next to the concierge desk. I felt completely safe with my bags there.We arrived back about 5 pm (after an afteroon at the British Museum) and checked in. But alas I forgot to ask for the complimentary sherry/whiskey. We were given room 301 (see picture for proof). I've read reviews about the infamous room 307 which was right down the hall from us. I heard some noise from the people upstairs walking around but nothing to complain about. The bedroom and the bathroom were both clean. The bed was comfortable and so were the pillows. The curtains kept the light out at night and during the day. The bathroom water pressure was what you would get in the U.S. and the hot water was constant. There were times when you got a rush of extra hot water for a few seconds. But not enough to burn you or to force you to adjust the water temperature while showering. The rack where the towels are hung is heated which was way cool. It is a hot-towel rack so you may want to keep little children away from it. We were given fresh towels each day. We brought our own toiletries. If you are relying on hotels to provide you with bottles of shampoo or soap you will have traveled unprepared. The view from the room was cool I wasn't expecting to look over a gratto or anything but it was a view of London and I liked it. I didn't think to take pictures of the first room we were in but it had the same bed and similar view out the window. The concierge staff at the hotel is competent and helpful when you ask them questions. Kudos go to Ali who put us in a room to relax while we were waiting for check in. To Byron for running (I am not making this up) from the hotel to the Lancaster Hotel three blocks away to give us our part of our tour bus ticket. It turns out that part of the ticket wasn't needed by the tour bus company but Byron went way beyond what was needed. I was so shocked by his effort I forgot to tip him. I did tip him the next day to his gracious disapproval. The rest of the concierge staff helped us with where to eat taking care of purchasing bus tours for us how to get to places and what things we should do during our stay. There was one time where I felt one of the staff was kind of grumpy but I just asked my questions and he answered it and off my wife and I went. Also when we first got to the hotel Ali ran outside to help us carry our bags in.The hotel locks the front door at night so as to keep out people not staying there. I liked this added security. It made my wife and I feel safe. Also you can't leave with your room key. Actually you don't want to leave with the key because it is heavy (and huge!). (see picture) Just leave it at the desk and pick it up when you return.The hotel is a little hard to find for a couple of reasons: 1) Street signs are hard to find (there usually attached to the buildings) and 2) We weren't familar with London or the area.So to help you people out there I am giving you the directions we took from Paddington station to the Royal Park. Prepare to cut and paste.If you are coming from Paddington Station exit to Praed St. We went out a big opening from the station directly from leaving the Heathrow Express train. It will look like a cobble street leading up to the outside. There will be a red mailbox on the left side of the entrance/exit and the Paddington Station Underground entrance on the right. When you get to street level there will be a hotel on your right that is connected to the station. You want to go across the street and turn right keeping the train station and hotel on your right side. The first street you come up to is Spring Street. (This is the street where I could not find a street sign for and thus got a little lost the first time around.) Cross the street where the red and black pub is (I think it's called the Paddignton Station Pub) and turn left. The train station should be behind you to your left when you get to the other side. The pub on the corner has wooden tables outside and specials written on the chalkboard. (NOTE: Praed Street turns into Carven Street if you don't make the left turn.) Now go all the way down the street until it intersects with a street called Sussex Gardens. Turn right on Sussex Gardens and there should be a row of houses on either side of you. You could probably see a church and a park directly ahead. Continue down this street staying in front of the row of houses on your right. Keep following the row of white houses keeping them on your right as you walk down the street and get closer to the church and park that will be on your left. The park is called Sussex Gardens Park. Keep the row of houses on your right constantly even when the houses start to curve to the right right. The church and park will be behind you when you make that gradual turn. There should be a fence with bushes growing on them and trees on your left. The Royal Park Hotel will be the one with the gold placards on the white Romanesque columns. Written on them is the name of the hotel Royal Park Hotel. The street on the other side of the trees fence and bushes is Westbourne Terrace. If for some reason you get to the end of row of houses turn around and go back toward the park and church and look again. I hope that helps. There will be a picture of the church and park from the side you need to be on. If you do get lost ask for directions to Sussex Gardens Park since this park is directly across the street from the hotel.Pictures of the hotel room bathroom view outside the widows the park and church directly across the street from the hotel are part of this review.This London hotel is well worth the price and if you want to experience the city stay at the Royal Park. My wife and I were extremely pleased by our stay there. We will go back there again. I would also use TripAdvisor again when researching hotels.","2013-09-17T14:44:25","128815.0","5","2013-09-17T12:42:15","ZD111380","Colorado","1983-01-01T00:00","80137","5.0"

I say it's impossible but maybe you have to think outside the box and use the area under the bed - but I think that's cheating...The rest of the inhabitants on the 7th floor were marauding teenagers and by day two the hotel decided it was easier to mover me rather than protect what little of their hotel remained.I did make a point of saying I didn't want a bigger or a better room or anything •À_ I hadn't paid for one and all I wanted was a quieter space... They could have got this so right but in the end they made such a big issue about my being given a club room and it was one of the best rooms in the hotel etc. etc...but before they would swap keys they had to take another imprint of my cc as they couldn't trust me not to nick anything from the mini bar - and then put me in 420 next to the lift shaft •À_ I ask you!Originally they said my new room would be ready at midday but that wasn't the case when I returned in the afternoon but don't get too excited •À_ its just a paint job and a new telly •À_ every thing else reused from old rooms and if they look behind the room door there is some ones old shower cap.So anyway they've turned me into a 'rant' - they won't or can't control their guests and in the meantime I get punished twice and get charged •À_270 for the privilege.You cant play the krypton factor in room 420 as they have swapped the squares for lines - which is fiendishly difficult.On day two at 4 am (17.02) the fire alarm went off and we all went outside to watch the fire engine. No one was on duty to shepherd the people at the back of the hotel •À_ very confusing and only one bloke on the front who shouted 'Gpherrede yeahahy mellodonnnehkay' down the loud speaker before disappearing and we all went back to bed except for the teenagers of course...At least the fire klaxon did work. I did wonder about that as 742 and 420 both have 'stepped' ceilings and I thought that all ceiling areas were supposed to be covered independently? But they are not. I took a picture to show the fire officer just in case.Later that same morning we were offered neither apology or explanation was that the 'Gpherrede yeahahy mellodonnnehkay' ? Just the prospect of another wait behind a 20 deep queue for breakfast in a half full room. Hotel is on record as being very proud of its international staff but I can assure you that all messages are translated and re translated several times before you get an answer. I think they should multi-train the chattering receptionists or several concierge staff to go and manage the breakfast queues when they get busy.The true highlight of my stay was finding the Cafe Concerto for Breakfast. This is 100 yards from the hotel on High Street Ken. There you are treated to a warm welcome a smiley helpful team who provide excellent service and a great breakfast. That was a real find after the debacle of 3 nights at Kensington chase. It looks like all the rooms are quite small (Probably due to space and business rates.?) so if you are going with a friend make sure it is some one you have a habit of bumping into or someone that you would like to bump into as this would be inevitable.Internet on 7th floor is non existent but they are happy enough to charge you up to •À_15 for a days access. Outrageous •À_ go and get yourselves a booster and a deal with Orange! Internet access costs diddly squit these days. They did give me my money back but was asked to sign a form saying they were giving me money although they don't give you a signed for saying you had paid them in the first place! I'm not interested in their internal accounting practices •À_ I just wanted my money back for something that didn't work •À_ simple. They debit your card for the room before arrival too.On hotel web site it proudly boats '4 star hotel' but this is a self assessment (not explained) and they are mistaken.I would urge every one to check and make sure they are staying in a place where the hotel has invested in a worthwhile scheme and not rely on self judgement as this can be very misleading and lead to disappointment.In a couple of years London will host the Olympics and we stand to be the tourism laughing stock of the world if these places don't get their act together.If you want to go and stay at the Kensington Close then do so but please arrive with little or no expectations and all your wishes will be fulfilled.I have stayed in many other guest houses and hotels that stand head and shoulders above this place in levels of comfort and service. London is my favourite city and personally I have never been so pleased to leave a hotel. They charged me •À_90.00 quid in advance for each night single occupancy ruined a short break and for •À_270 pounds in 2009 - we all deserve so much better''I ent a copy of my review as i thought that the mgt deserved at least the right to reply - their sales coordinator wanted to know more details so on 19 February 2009 19:06:46 I sent e-mail to Manoj Dudhe who hasn't bothered to reply.

We also enjoyed the Alcatraz tour and several attractions which was included in the City Pass. The City pass also allowed you to ride the Muni and Trolley cars. We rented our rental car at Budget also on Van Ness Ave after we checked out and drove to Lake Tahoe and then to Reno. I would certainly recommend Comfort Inn By the Bay and I would return to this hotel on my next visit..

We spent 1 night at the Argonaut Hotel and 3 nights at The Palace either side of a fly drive vacation to California in July last year. The Argonaut is undoubtedly a fantastic hotel but we thought the Palace was even better and the cost was exactly the same for a room for 4 people at that time of the year.We had a couple of very minor problems when we arrived. For example there were only 3 sets of towels for the 4 of us. There were only 2 bathrobes. The housekeeping Department were rather quirky. It took several phone calls and trips to the room before we had the full compliment of linens.But putting these niggles aside the rest of our stay was superb. We had a suite.It consisted of a double room with 2 queen sized beds. Then leading off the bedroom was a small 'parlour' with a comfortable sofa coffee table laden with magazines tv and writing desk. Furnished with smart 'classic' antique-style furnishings the rooms were spotless as was the gleaming marble bathroom. There was a power shower and crisp white bedlinen.The public rooms are opulent. This is a grand old hotel with quite a history. We particularly liked the cosy wood panelled 'Pied Piper Bar' with its black and white photos of famous visitors (everyone from Kruschev to the Kennedys). Unsurprisingly food is pricey but the quality was good. If you decide to forgo the buffet breakfast there is a Starbucks on the corner of the block. It is in a great location. Convenient for SFMoma Yerba Buena Gardens and the shops at Union Square. It is also on the edge of the financial district so wonderfully quiet at the weekends. We heard no noise from other rooms and we had the pool to ourselves each afternoon. In short I would highly recommend this hotel for a family on vacation. A stay here is a real treat and was one of the highlights of our trip to California.","2013-09-17T13:44:53","136048.0","-2","2013-09-17T11:23:06","ZD111340","Florida","1968-01-01T00:00","32833","5.0"

I stayed before at the CP Qingdao and the CP Park View Beijing. Both hotels were bedder than this one. The executive suite here is smaller then with the other hotels but the price is higher ok its Beijing. The club floor personnel sometimes seems not to like their guests very much. The service at the Lobby Lounge has to be called if you want something to drink. Pool sauna etc. is small and looks a little worn out (pool at CP Park View is incredible big an nice). Today sauna was cold. Food is good room is clean but a little dark. But the location is perfect for tourists!!! 20 min. walk to forbidden city and TienAnMen. Shopping street just outside. But you hear the typical Chinese traffic. Internet free of charge as well as two drinks (beer) from the minibar (nice touch).

The room was not huge (most urban rooms are not) but it was very efficiently designed. We each had a twin bed (pushed together in the space of a queen or king) but I never knew my son was beside me--it was very comfortable. The beds each had a fluffy duvet with no top sheet (that's how the males in our house prefer it anyway); however the duvet cover was thin and was changed with the sheets for each new guest. The A/C was easy to control; I have no idea if the adjacent rooms were noisy because I turned on the fan during the night and never heard a peep from outside our room. The bathroom was small but nice--a shower gel dispenser was in the shower and the bath towels were large and fluffy. The shower head height was adjustible and the water pressure was great. The best part of our room was the iMac--I downloaded photos each day to iPhoto and posted them on a website for friends and family to see. The iMac stores your data while you are using the room (photos for example) and when you leave you shut it down and your data is erased. I was afraid I would have to save everything to a flash drive but that was not necessary. I talked to several American tourists who were had either no internet service or if they did it was very pricey. They implied that the traditional hotels in the area were not as service-oriented as they were used to. Our stay included either a continental breakfast or a full English breakfast. I tried the full English breakfast one morning just to say I had but the other days I had the continental. It was wonderful--they had cheese and tomato croissants a cheese tray a meat tray pastries toast fresh fruit and juices (and I'm probably leaving something out because that's just what I had)! The only thing I would change would be to move the hotel a few blocks closer to an Underground Station! The weather was great so my son and I walked back and forth (about a five minute walk) to Pimlico Station and we walked the other direction (maybe 10 minutes) to Westminster Abbey and The Palaces at Westminster (Houses of Parliament). The hotel is in a quiet business neighborhood (it's right across the street from Thames House--sshh--I'm sure they got plenty of security camera footage of me) but there is a pub called The Westminster about two blocks away if you want pub food.All in all I will DEFINITELY stay there if I ever go to London again!","2013-09-17T13:54:57","136921.0","0","2013-09-17T12:10:47","ZD111525","Georgia","1980-01-01T00:00","30048","5.0"

Overall my 6th trip to Vegas and first time ever staying off the strip. Past hotels include TheHotel Bellagio Monte Carlo Venetian and Wynn. For the price this is definitely up there.Pros: ***Spa was really nice and relaxing. Secluded private 'spa only' pools hot tubs cabanas etc etc... ***Poolside cabanas 200/day weekdays 350/day fri-sat-sun. 32 plasma tv couches mister ceiling fan spekers private changing room in cabana dedicated wait staff complimentary unlimited water red bull naked juice (4 flavors) sparkling water fruit platter nuts and salsa/chips. Poolside bar a little expensive but not over the top. $15 burger $12 margarita. ***King signature suites are about 1000/sq feet. 2 42 plasmas bose clock-radio with supplied iPod hookup cable 1 and 1/2 bath 4 phones complimentary shoe-shine service (i got mine done twice!) wet bar 2 fridges really comfy beds. HUGE whirlpool tub plasma in the bathroom separate water closet in master bathroom room safe was oversized and in the wall so it didn't take up 1/2 the closet very clean. ***LBS burger joint was great ($30 for 2 people incl. tip - not bad for lunch - average) ***Diner 'Grand Cafe' was good and super cheap ($20 for 2 people incl. tip for lunch) ***Starbucks on site open 24/7 right outside of casino ***TONS of non-smoking sections within the casino ***There's a CVS/Supermarkey nearby which is definitely 'walkable' if you're in halfway decent shape if you need some incidentals or would like to stock the spare fridge with some stuff.***Bingo Hall had secluded smoking section. (Yes we're 30 and tried playing bingo hahaha) - very fun***Staff was super helpful and friendly. They have A3 Service which stands for anything anytime anywhere - basically you call down and if you want cocoa puffs with a pair of Adidas at 3am - they'll get it for you. Didn't test it out but seems like it would be nice to have in an emergency.***Overall clientele was on the 'clean-cut' side. Not being a snob but you know what I mean... not too much trailer trash and/or hood-rats.***Town Car Drivers from BLS Limo out front were great. Even offered free line cut passes to us for Ghost Bar and Excess for nothing. I'm not a club person so I didn't take them up on it. Either way a nice gesture.Cons: ***Free Shuttle to the strip only runs a few times a day and is first come-first serve and only runs until 10pm. (lets face it ... do they really want you spending your money at other casinos?) We took it once and it only drops you off at the fashion show mall which is all the way at the northern-most end of the strip. It was crowded and hot. The rest of the time we took a town car to the strip at $55/trip....Probably spend a good $300-400 just on transportation to and from the strip for the 4 days/3 nights we were there... Then again if you're looking to save $$ stay in old vegas.***Free Internet is only available in the rooms while all public areas are billed at $9.99 for every two hours....***Shower wasn't as hot as I liked it - but not everyone likes a super hot shower so this may not be a 'con' to everyoneHope this helps you plan your trip.

The room would have felt small even with only two people.  After the first night we moved to the Holiday Inn Kensington across the street.

(Most of the time I took the stairs as doing so was much faster than waiting for the elevator).The room was tiny but I kind of expected that to some extent. The view was of the adjacent building but one doesn't go to a hotel like this for the view. TV reception (which seemed to be over the air not cable?) was fuzzy.The phone required a deposit even for local calls (and they were expensive). My cell phone didn't work inside the building so I had to step outside each time I needed to make a call.The bathroom was ok if a bit musty. However in 2002 I noticed some flaking wall material near the radiator. This was unnerving as visions of asbestos danced in my head....In 2000 there was a little breakfast room and upon check-in customers were given vouchers good for breakfast. After one breakfast dealing with low-quality food and snotty staff I decided to have my breakfast elsewhere. This facility had closed entirely when I went back in 2002; I don't know if they've ever reopened it. (There's a adjacent Chinese restaraunt that may be associated with this hotel but I didn't try it).The immediate neighborhood is fine (on 25th between 5th and 6th Aves) is fine but somewhat dim after dark. You're not too far away from busier streets (and 24-hour delis) though....The subway is just a block south and plenty of buses and cabs ply 5th and 6th ave. The hotel will also call a car service for you if you need to get to the airports.All in all probably not the worst place but you can probably do better with careful searching of the travel sites discussion groups and of course Tripadvisor!","2013-09-17T14:21:22","101889.0","0","2013-09-17T12:52:14","ZD111386","Michigan","1972-01-01T00:00","49654","5.0"

They have a short stay parking area directly in front of the hotel and the doorman took our keys and made arrangements to park the car immediately. We were checking out the room within 10 minutes of driving up to the hotel - AMAZING! The large king-size room was nicely appointed (although it could have used a larger flat panel TV). CD stereo was already on in the room with classical music quietly playing - nice touch. The bed was made with crisp white linens lots and lots of feather pillows and a comfy duvet. A soft brown coverlet was carefully placed on the corner of the bed. There were plenty of places in the room to sit and enjoy a glass of wine (two comfy chairs in front of the electric fireplace at the desk a small table with chairs by the closet or the lovely chair and foot rest by the window.

The attention to detail in the room was exceptional and the amenities were nice too.All in all I would recommend this hotel for its location rooms AND service!","2013-09-17T11:30:50","156002.0","4","2013-09-17T10:16:39","ZD111497","Michigan","2013-01-01T00:00","48327","5.0"

I had made a reservation with Palace Station via JetBlue for $68/two nights. After I checked out and got back to California I found Palace station billed me an unexpected service fee for $32.68 on my credit card bill. I expressed my concern and disappointment with their Front Desk manager; she told me that it is mandatory additional service fee that applied to customer and every single victim have to pay that (she told me with an arrogant and firm tone). She also claimed that she was not responsible for any Web site agencies if any of them never gave me or any others victims in advance notice on this shady hidden charged. Frankly I cannot agree with her claim. First I asked for a receipt with their front desk personnel when I check out but he told me that I am all set. Receipt will be acquired from my Web site agency. Unfortunately Palace Station billed me after I got back to California and I had been billed without any notice. Therefore it is totally involuntary. Second I don•À_t believe Palace Station Hotel deserve any illegal right to involuntary bill any of their customer. Third she never asked me which agency where I made my reservation. That•À_s reflected she doesn•À_t care about customer•À_s satisfaction with an expensive additional service fee. Personally I suspicious for their intention on quality control in billing. If they meant to be a faithful and trustworthy business why they won•À_t don•À_t even bother to ask where I made my reservation in hopes to correct any mistake in future. Personally I hope such kind of shady hidden charged is not a set up toentrap any misfortunate victim. My finial question is if Palace Station Hotel believed that they deserve or worth for an additional $16.32/night why they never mark their additional charge clearly included on their listed price please answer me if you have a clue.","2013-09-17T14:55:19","126696.0","4","2013-09-17T12:45:40","ZD111154","Minnesota","2001-01-01T00:00","55956","5.0"

I needed a room with two beds and had booked two-person reservation in a Grand room over the internet (an upgrade from the regular Deluxe room) but it wasn't clear if it came with two beds or not so I called to confirm. They confirmed that we had indeed booked a two bed Grand room. The day we checked in the clerk must have seen the note that I called and confirmed with me that I needed two beds. I said yes I booked a Grand room with two beds. He excused himself for a minute and went into the back and then came back and said everything was in order and gave me my keys. What had actually happened was that they didn't have a Grand room with two beds so they silently downgraded us to a Deluxe room but didn't discount our rate. Seeing as we were staying there for a week that would have cost us $210 more! Once we realized what had happened we called down to complain and they begrudgingly discounted our rate for us and told us that if we wanted a Grand room we'd have to call every day to check. What awful customer service! I called back and got someone more reasonable who scheduled us for a room change the next day to a Grand room and also offered us the Deluxe room rate for the duration of the stay. This should have been offered right off the bat I shouldn't have had to spend an hour calling people.The rest of the stay was average and uneventful but this initial deception really made an impression on me and I wouldn't stay there again.","2013-09-17T13:23:04","152263.0","4","2013-09-17T10:07:50","ZD111243","New Jersey","1977-01-01T00:00","8056","5.0"

The location was perfect with Lancaster Gate station a minutes walk away and on the Central Line and the scenic Hyde Park just across the street. The hotel`s interior was top class too and we really felt we got more for our money staying here than we would have staying in some of the well-known chain hotels. We stayed in a family room and when I saw the room from the outside I paniced slighty as it looked a bit like a store cupboard with elevators on either side of it but once inside these worries disappeared as it was spacious and the decor was modern clean and stylish. My son`s bed was separate from ours with the bathroom in the middle so he felt a bit like he had his own room which was good. He was especially impressed with the green lighting in the bathroom (the dimmed version) and the wall mounted tv pretty decent hairdryer kettle and handy ironing board were all great. I have to say the hotel staff were all extremely pleasant also without it being put on. They seemed to work in a happy environment which you don`t always get in hotels. My son again especially loved that when we came back to our room at night those who had cleaned it had laid all his toys and teddies out on his bed for him. This was a nice touch. The full engish breakfast was great too with a choice of hot foods and cereals etc. We had a small wait one morning for breakfast (15mins max) but the hotel had left a note in our room to let us know that as they were particularly busy that weekend that they expected a wait at breakfast and advised guests to come a bit earlier if they were in a hurry. Again this was a nice touch and although the hotel was very busy it never felt that way. Even though we were right beside the lifts I don`t recall ever being disturbed by them the three nights we stayed. Overall the hotel had a great feel to it very calm spacious and friendly. I never usually write reviews but the length of this one should show how impressed I was by the hotel!","2013-09-17T14:11:56","101871.0","1","2013-09-17T10:56:22","ZD111560","New Jersey","1951-01-01T00:00","7836","5.0"

This place and Jet Luxury Resorts are a real winner.* You need to know that Signature is a condominium property. The condos are managed by different management companies. They are responsible for your suite cleanliness amenities etc. not MGM. Jet Luxury Resorts managed our unit. What a superb management company.* The personnel at Jet Luxury Resorts are just super. I can't recommend them highly enough. Due to poor planning on my part I had to change my reservation at the last minute. They were more than accommodating. These people are just great to work with. I definitely recommend using Jet Luxury Resorts.* What spectacular accommodations. Our unit a one bedroom suite was extremely spacious and comfortable. Interestingly the unit had two full bathrooms. The guest bath has a shower. I assume that's so you can separate the living and bedroom into two completely separate bedrooms. Great idea.* You have room charge privileges at the MGM. Very handy for incidental and restaurant charges.* The only negative see is that the property is about a 10 minute walk away from the MGM casino/hotel. A covered walkway with moving walkways is the way to get to the casino. Along the way are numerous shops restaurants and attractions. The food court is along the walkway.* All in all I highly recommend The Signature at MGM Grand and Jet Luxury Resorts.

However I now feel the need to after reading some of the recent negative comments.)Having stayed at several B&amp;Bs and guest houses throughout England andEurope we decided to treat ourselves to a hotel on our return to London. We managed to get a good rate at the Paddington Hilton (including breakfast) otherwise it would have been out of our price range.Yes - The normal room rates and other costs - drinks etc etc are high but no higher than in any other hotel of the same quality in London. One has to realise that London is an expensive place to visit.Yes - Our room was quite a walk from the lifts but that was not a problem for us. It is a big hotel after all. Yes - Our king size bed was 2 single mattresses together but most importantly they were extremely comfortable.Yes - The bedding was a duvet between two sheets but that made it easier to peel off any un-needed layers.Yes - The breakfast is an expensive one if it's not included in your rate. However it was an excellent buffet of all cereals a huge variety of fruit juices breads muffins croissants yoghurts etc etc. Plus cooked - bacon sausages black pudding &amp; white pudding (for the adventurous) baked beans tomatoes all variety of eggs etc etc. Plus individually made omelettes with your choice of fillings as well as bottomless cups of coffee tea milo etc. And it was all constantly replenished throughout the morning.What more could one want from a breakfast buffet???(We also experienced 'full English breakfasts' at the many B&amp;Bs we stayed at and have absolutely no complaints. English food is typically great but the Hilton's breakfast buffet was exceptional). We found the hotel to be fantastic. Our room was 'classically English' in decor and extremely comfortable and extremely clean. The bathroom was really lovely and the shower was perfect. We were on the3rd floor overlooking Praed St but there was no problem with noise.The location is fantastic and extremely convenient for public transport as many others have mentioned.The hotel staff were all really friendly and couldn't be more helpfulin all areas.So all in all it was a very very enjoyable treat and we would definitely stay there again if at all possible.","2013-09-17T14:03:05","110503.0","-5","2013-09-17T12:23:10","ZD111470","Ohio","1950-01-01T00:00","43211","5.0"

We packed our stuff and walked right next door to the Singh Sahib hotel. I think my Indian friend was learning by now as he said that the Singh Sahib was a little more money and all they had left was a suite but that was OK as it was more important that we were comfortable where we stayed.In the Singh Sahib we were placed in a suite on the 1st floor right behind check in. It appeared that the hotel looked new and they were still renovating a little. The restaurant was still not complete. However the room was large and clean and new and had a working AC. It also did not reek of cigarettes. Unfortunately I•À_m not sure how long it will stay that way as the hotel apparently appeals to smokers. I chastised a Chinese guest stepping off the elevator with a lit cigarette and his response was that there was no sign. I was sure that not smoking in an elevator was a universal courtesy?As I said the room was new cleanly marbled and freshly painted. As nice as it was there still were some quirky problems. First although everything appeared clean the workers neglected to clean the walls around the toilet just a small oversight. Also they had a cheap temporary curtain that went across the bathroom covering the shower and tub. This we found was prone to come down easily. There was hot water but it took a while to show up. There were frequent electricity outages but only for a minute or two.The soaps were the best quality we found during our travels in India. They brought extra towels on request. There was no mini bar in the room. Breakfast was included but because the restaurant was closed we had to order by room service. There was a small glitch in getting the food but it finally came. We had to then ask for silverware and napkins. We were surprised to find French toast on the menu but it came plain and they offered no syrup. We went to compliment the front desk and apparent owners on the quality of the hotel and rooms. We were told that they must have the cheap curtains in the bathrooms as the Indian guests bathe with the bucket and cup splashing the water over their bodies to rinse and in the process drench the room. They really were not interested in talking to me. When I asked to take a couple of pictures of another room to post on TA they refused and handed me a pamphlet saying I could see the pictures there.The one thing that really upset me about this hotel was the scam the owners appeared to be playing on their guests. I•À_m not sure if it actually hurt the guests but it was probably more to shield their income from the government. I watched as they appeared to overcharge one of the Chinese guests checking out. She was tough and those guys were not going to get one over on her. When she asked for a receipt they tried to talk around the subject and finally went to write a receipt on a piece of note paper. The girl insisted on an official invoice and they finally succumb. It was funny when she asked why they had to play all of these games for which they replied with a sly meekish smile. Unfortunately I still think they were up to something as they gave her the original and kept the copy receipt. I did not realize they did the same thing to my travel agent friend who paid the bill for me. When I was later telling him about the Chinese girl we looked at our receipt and found they had done the same thing to him. We went back later to reclaim our bags being held for us after check out and made them give us a proper invoice.Again this place is right next door to the Hotel Metro Heights. Both have front desk people that are plenty rough around the edges but the Singh Sahib is ten times better.

I've stayed in Shanghai before and this is my favorite hotel (although I'm sure the Park Hyatt will give them some compeition.)I sprung for the Horizons Club level with Bund View in the older tower. While it's pricey enough many extras make it worth the upcharge (e.g. internet acess included as well as many amenities in the club lounge) and would be a bargain in many other cities.Room 2424 is very spacious with floor-to-ceiling views of the Bund and the fun-but-goofy Pearl Tower. The view is particularly stunning at night when the Bund's art deco buildings light up the more modern Pudong buildings put on their lights and the dinner cruises turn on their colored lights and parade up and down the river. On a Saturday night we were also treated to fireworks.Again the room and bathroom are very spacious with spotless housekeeping. Modern/sleek Asian influenced furnishings provided a lot of drawer and closet space all the usual electronics and a roomy desk for working. Our room had a sofa in the sitting area and flowers and fresh fruit were always on the cocktail table. There are many amenities that you expect in a finer hotel including robes coffee/tea maker ironing board separate tub and shower loads of toiletries and complimentary necessities (e.g. toothbrush razor nail clipper etc. -- you could be shipwrecked here and still look presentable.)The Horizons Club lounge is wonderful with views to the river and Bund. The breakfast buffet is quite extensive with many things for Asian and western tastes. This includes many hot items (always some steamed dumplings and other Asian items; always some kind of egg dish with sausages and meats;) many cereals fresh fruit and juice options; many cold breakfast items (cheese etc.) exellent bakery and pasteries; etc. The drawbacks are relatively minor: coffee and tea are mostly serve-yourself and the machine goes ONE cup at a time leading to back-ups at busy periods. Eventually the staff comes around with coffee or tea to ease the line but it is not automatic. Also: Monday is cooked-to-order omlet day -- NOT an everyday option.Also in the lounge: the bountiful teatime with pastries segways into cocktail time with lovely snacks and cheeses and very nice assortment of wine beer soft drinks and liquor available. As you would expect: there is an internet-access terminal available for guests an assortment of newspapers sofas and TV and 2 hours of the use of one of their conference rooms can be reserved.The public rooms and lounges are classy and beautiful. The main lounge in the older tower has soaring windows that face the river but the view may be blocked by landscaping for an immediate view. This room has music (often classical) during formal tea time and something jazzier in the evening that seems to change nightly. There is also a bar in the new tower with great views but the music to me is not as pleasureable (that kind of techno-rock that I find grating but seems the thing to show that you are modern.)Each tower has a fitness area with lap pools and firness equipment. The newer tower has a more extensive spa which I didn't try.There are a number of good restaurants on site mostly upscale and Asian. The all-purpose Cafe Yi that serves breakfast through dinner has an extensive multi-cultural menu. However the layout is somewhat confusing which can lead to buffet diners missing some options. Still I wish they'd have a plain mixed green salad on teh a la carte menu to accompany and dinners -- the closest they come is a Caesar salad prepared in the classic way -- with essence of anchoivies in the dressing. 'Sometimes you're just not in the mood...The staff throughout the hotel is exceptional -- polished friendly knowledgeable and very willing to help. I especially appreciate the service with taxis. If you ask the Concierge gives you a form note that identifies where you'd like to go. The staff at the taxi stand makes sure that the driver is clear about your destination. There are a number of dining options within walking distance of the hotel including in the Superbrands Mall (some electronics stores but otherwise mostly shops that appeal to younger adults.) The dining options there are mostly Asian but also include a McDonald's a Fresh Cafe for excellent healthier items (ground level with outside entrance) Hooters (next door if you must) etc. The riverfront park also has many restaurants and outdoor optons but we didn't try any of them. We may next time.There are a few excellent (but pricey) restaurants nearby on and near the Bund. Get there via the really cheap ferry that continually goes back and forth across the river. The dock is about a 7 minute walk from the back door of the hotel. Three on the Bund contains many of them: Laris Wampoa Club Jean-Georges (yes THAT Jean-Georges) New Heights (for more casual bistro-type food.)Some may complain that Pudong isn't the best location but it suits my professional needs and really is not that much of an issue. Again the ferry to the other side is cheap and the cabs are still really pretty cheap -- $3 - 4 U.S. gets you to just about any of the Shanghai sites you'd want to go to.An aside from other visits: while the Ritz-Carlton Portman is nice it feels colder and corporate than the Shangri-La's classy luxury and Asian feel. Also: when we went to the CJW at the Westin (wonderful dinner and service with a view) the lobby seemed much too loud to be pleasant on a daily basis. The point: I'd much rather stay at the Shangi-La and take a taxi or ferry to other places I'd want to go.I've stayed at other Shangri-La's that were nice but not quite as impressive as this (e.g. New Delhi) so I don't expect this to be every Shangri-La experience. However for an in-town stay that didn't involve a suite this place tops my charts.","2013-09-17T13:05:27","101147.0","-5","2013-09-17T10:15:56","ZD111490","Pennsylvania","2014-01-01T00:00","16637","5.0"

We were stunned to find out how small and uncomfortable the bed was and could not get a proper night sleepat all. I complained but all I got was an offer to switch to a suite at a price which was over $800 a night... (And yes I told the girl at the front desk I am going to write about my experience so others could learn to avoid this hotelto no avail).This is a relatively nice hotel small (105 rooms I was told...)nicely done &amp; clean with good service and great location.The drawback is the VERY small size room I mean V E R Y small which found me banging my head over the stonecladded side table while turning at night... and yes again traveling with my wife she asked for an inflatable matress (They had none...) and could not get to sleep properly either. We would not consider this place again. There are many other hotels in the same block for this price. Do not forget to ask specifically for a minimum of Queen size bed for two adults in a room since what is the standard in any chiep motel in the US is special in a Boutique hotel in Manhatten. Though we made reservations well ahead of time and arrived early in the day we were not properly accomodated. Take this into considerations while dealling with this hotel.","2013-09-17T11:59:42","145976.0","2","2013-09-17T11:23:17","ZD111476","Pennsylvania","1967-01-01T00:00","17961","5.0"

A tasty continental breakfast is included and a per night coupon for glass of wine &amp; cheese between 5 and 7pm was also an unexpected surprise (it was a healthy glass too!)We arrived around 12:30 from our five-hour drive from Toronto. They have a short stay parking area directly in front of the hotel and the doorman took our keys and made arrangements to park the car immediately. We were checking out the room within 10 minutes of driving up to the hotel - AMAZING! The large king-size room was nicely appointed (although it could have used a larger flat panel TV). CD stereo was already on in the room with classical music quietly playing - nice touch. The bed was made with crisp white linens lots and lots of feather pillows and a comfy duvet. A soft brown coverlet was carefully placed on the corner of the bed. There were plenty of places in the room to sit and enjoy a glass of wine (two comfy chairs in front of the electric fireplace at the desk a small table with chairs by the closet or the lovely chair and foot rest by the window. The bathroom was also quite extravagant - huge 2 person Jacuzzi and large glass shower (although it could have used two shower heads!) The toilet area was a bit cramped and the bathroom could have used a bit more light (getting old!). The attention to detail in the room was exceptional and the amenities were nice too.All in all I would recommend this hotel for its location rooms AND service!","2013-09-17T15:04:33","136711.0","-5","2013-09-17T12:22:29","ZD111236","Tennessee","1994-01-01T00:00","37076","5.0"

My partner who is in the travel industry and I were both VERY impressed with this hotel. LOCATION: Its in a great area of San Fran and has the trolley stop right on its door steps. YOu can take the trolley for a 15min ride down to China town or switch trains to Union Square (shopping area). I will say that the trolly makes it easier then trying to walk up and down the hills in San Fran. We did it the first day and that was enough for us to get a one day pass.ROOMS: The suite we had on the 10th floor had wonderful views of the city. Since the building is on a hill...we looked down on the whole city. Room was bigger then my living room with a nice comfy bed and pillows. The sitting area was a sofacoffee table and 2 chairs. Again very rich looking. Small kitchen area (sink and mini bar). TV was great and lots of closet space. Bathroom had a shower/tub which was huge. The glass door made the shower seem even bigger. I loved the seperate toilet/shower area to the double sinks. Turn down service was amazing...with night cream for the face and a breakfast menu left for you to fill out. Complimentry Shoe shine if you left them outside your door.POOL. Cute small pool. nice sitting area around pool to relax and read the paper. We never used the pool since thats not what we went to San Fran for. But at least we knew it was available.PARKING- none. But you can valet for 30.00 a night (which we did). SERVICE- Amazing. Wake up calls were on time. Check in and out was also great and fast.We were super impressed with the care everyone has for you. Doormen knew us as we walked in and out and always helped with anything we needed.So there has to be something wrong right&gt;???Yes we found the carpet in the room COULD be changed and the hallways might get a little bit of an upgrade.....but it expected from such an old place.OVERALL this is a great classy place and we would stay here again. The location and service is worth the extra money you will spend and your stay will be full of luxury.","2013-09-17T14:01:48","125783.0","0","2013-09-17T12:50:24","ZD111306","Texas","1954-01-01T00:00","77643","5.0"

When we got there no double bed room was available.2. The receptionist (named Jude) told us that this is only temporary and someone will move our belonging to another room with double bed the next morning while we are out travelling. This was not done.3. We asked for a wakeup call at 7:30 and received it 20 minutes later. We complain and were told that the wake up list says 7:50.4. the concierge told us that all events start at 11:00 on Sundays which is simply not true.On the other side John the receptionist was really nice professional and helpful.I'm describing this as this seems like a pattern and not a random mistake. We saw another complain earlier in the reviews and wondered about the odds that this will happen to us. Well...it just did.Besides that the hotel location is great. Only 100m from the tube tesco and pret a manger.In addition if you go to this hotel 50m north to the hotel there is a construction site. We haven't stayed in a north room so we're not sure about the noise coming from this site but this should also take under consideration.In addition the hotel is very clean (so say my wife) and provide all the needed facilities - safe in the room minibar (cost money) TV (not LCD) playstation (cost money) ok bed and shower.All in all I wouldn't recommend going to this hotel just because the problems we had with 3 out of 4 staff members.","2013-09-17T12:20:57","120845.0","-3","2013-09-17T11:55:20","ZD111196","Arizona","1961-01-01T00:00","85045","5.0"

What a fabulous time to be in New York City (NYC) a must do!!! Lots of lights and beautiful Christmas displays everywhere this is an opportunity for kids to really enjoy the season and adults to relive their childhood!***To the room it was a good size with adaquate storage. The room had a laptop safe with room for other valuables as well. The washroom was a bit small but nothing we couldn't work with. ***Room service was quick when we asked for extras. We never ordered food or ate in the hotel restaurant as there are alot of dining choices around the hotel including lil Korea which is just two blocks over. We even got a few work outs in the hotel gym.*** To avoid the noise from the street we requested a room on a higher floor near the back of the hotel. In saying this we would use our earplugs again as noisy car horns and garbage trucks rumbling through are just part of the ambiance in NYC. *** We started each morning with a healthy serving of tasty and healthy breakfast delights in the lounge which was included in the room charge. The staff were prepared with enough food and seating to fit everyone even during days when there were big events such as Black Friday and the Macy's Day Parade. ***The hotel is centrally located to local attractions and there is a subway station 1/2 a block away. Macy's is 1/2 block away the Empire State Building is 1 block away and Time Square is only a 10 minute walk while the uptown attractions like Central Park Trump Tower etc are about a 25 minute walk away. ***We will book again at the Hotel Metro. Thank you to all of those who had taken the time to share their experiences on Tripadvisor.***NYC is a must see destination and very friendly city but be prepared to open up your wallet from the time you get off the plane until you are back on the plane. It is worth everyone penny!***Thanks Tripadvisor.","2013-09-17T11:16:55","102018.0","1","2013-09-17T09:39:03","ZD111271","California","1953-01-01T00:00","90713","5.0"

It is undoubtedly the WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN and I would never stay there again.1. Internet is charged at a full hour rate (AED 10) even for 5 minutes check of an email. The internet area is in a dining area and food can be placed out around you when at the PC.2. Check out efficiency was the worst I have ever encountered. The clerk needed to ring the room service to check the mini-bar while we waited for 20 minutes3. We had ordered and pre-paid for a triple room WHICH WAS NOT PREPARED ON ARRIVAL. After eventually getting one trundle rollaway which had to be sent back because it was soiled the second eventually collapsed in the middle of the night. Reception transferred us next morning at 7 am to a room with 3 distinct beds. Then we had to organize for triple toiletries towels extra cups coffee and water.4. The alarm went off at 3:45 am on the first night having been preset by the previous tenants. 5. The Air Conditioning did not work nor could we open our windows. IT WAS NOT FIXED FOR OUR 5 NIGHT STAY!6. THE LIGHT SWITCH NEXT TO THE DESK HAD EXPOSED COPPER WIRING THROUGH THE TORN INSULATION. This was an extreme electrical safety hazard.7. Breakfast was absolutely boring and repetitive being essentially INDIAN in cuisine. The sitar player each morning was irritating. Scrambled eggs were repeatedly runny and I actually saw chefs handling waffles with their bare hands. Coffee always ran out.11. American Express traveler's cheques are converted at a VERY low rate compared to money exchangers outside.","2013-09-17T13:00:18","110726.0","-5","2013-09-17T11:04","ZD111248","California","1975-01-01T00:00","90293","5.0"

Since another viewer brought the mistake to my attention I wanted to make sure I reviewed the correct hotel since we had such a wonderful experience. Went to NYC for New Years Eve so obviously this hotel was a great location. The staff was terriffic and always helpful especially Steven Reyes (parking) and Jonathan ?(Asian gentleman at front desk). The hotel is beautiful inside and convenient to many places. Go up and have dinner or dessert at the rotating restaurant on the top floor. Very nice view. Great breakfast buffet in the lobby restaurant plus Starbucks is right inside hotel too. Not too sure about normal rates but our rate was outrageous due to it being New Years Eve on Time Square. Our room faced the ball drop! Besides price I would definitely recommend to anyone. Also walk over to Juniors for breakfast lunch or dinner. Wonderful diner food and great cheesecake. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone who is not on a tight budget!","2013-09-17T14:39:59","103088.0","-5","2013-09-17T09:21:58","ZD111171","California","2000-01-01T00:00","91122","5.0"

I had to wait behind a pilot who got very frustrated that it took them 10 minutes to process his payment for one beer from the minibar. They took an equally long time to process me.The hotel has a strange smell that pervades every part of it - smells like cleaning products. Not good smells like a (clean) toilet.Room was what you would expect for this price but perhaps a little frayed around the edges. Could do with a refurb.Taxi's affiliated with the hotel are crooks. They over-charge dreadfully (my local-colleagues advised me of the proper prices). DO NOT USE THE HOTEL TAXIS (other than airport service) get one on the meter.Bar was good with friendly service however the bar food was disgusting - very old calamari was re-deep fried and inedible. I complained and they replaced with other average dish.Cup of coffee to go took about 10 minutes and cost about •À_8. It was tepid and flavourless.Apparently the pub and buffet are quite good but I did not visit either of these.Checking out took 14 minutes (I timed it!). There was no staff on the front desk and when someone did arrive the computer system locked them out and we had to wait for someone from IT to allow them to check me out.","2013-09-17T11:29:32","131283.0","3","2013-09-17T09:17:15","ZD111142","California","1970-01-01T00:00","92586","5.0"

Having said that i defer you back to my first paragraph.When you break it down the room was nice and clean with little wear and tear to my eyes the price was great and it is a hotel room. Unless one is staying in a suite somewhere it is a hotel room. View was not great and location is not the best. So one takes taxi or bus (which is convenient) to billion dollar casino corridor. Everyone does a lot of walking anyway so I wouldnt sweat the small stuff and a $8 taxi ride. Although traffic at night can get pretty bad on the strip.If you are on a budget I highly recommend the riveria or Imperial palace. If not and wantt o spend more money on convenience views and amenities such as nice pools then head up towards Treasure Island.","2013-09-17T14:11:14","104135.0","0","2013-09-17T11:04:41","ZD111370","California","2018-01-01T00:00","92278","5.0"

Similar to any budget hotels although it lacks a few amenities that I consider basic: wi-fi in the rooms fridge vending machines etc.- The visitors are mainly Asian tourists and young travelers both of which you hardly see or hear.The Bad:- Zero security: there are three entrances to the hotel and they are unmanned the concierge is on a separate floor from the entrances and anyone can walk-in any of those entrances and take the elevator to any floor in the hotel. There are also no security camera's.- It is 1 meter away from a busy bridge on which the Coney Island express runs and a major road runs underneath. It is extremely loud and the hotel shakes.- There is zero customer service I personally am not very demanding and don't often need much but this was ridiculous. The staff were not willing to help you out with anything and/or did not now the answer to most of the questions asked and were surprised to be asked very basic questions such as where can I buy some water?. ---The Area----The Good:- As far as lower east side hotels this one is fairly cheap and decent. It is close to Brooklyn and LES and a short walk to the subway.The Bad:- This place is dead...DEAD(for emphasis) after 9 p.m. or so. Everything is boarded up and there is no where to grab a bite or buy snacks. Only the homeless roam the area after a certain hour and although they are harmless if your alone it can be unpleasant. - It is in China Town so it is a bit dirty from the food stores. ---The Rooms---The Good:- They are typical of the price range no frills modest decor. This one is relatively new and things are kept very clean.-Bathroom en-suite no sharing.The Bad:- They are small the train running past is loud the windows don't open.- We didn't really want to go back there much and sometimes after a long day you need to re-charge for a bit before heading out again. ---The Price---- Overall it is not that cheap that it would be worthwhile staying here. I would recommend moving uptown or midtown to the cheaper hotels there despite the less desirable location and being further from LES.- They charge you for storing your bag after checkout; I have never encountered this. They have this dingy internet access station where they charge you quite a lot for internet access.","2013-09-17T12:26:59","136929.0","1","2013-09-17T10:06:49","ZD111179","California","1955-01-01T00:00","95378","5.0"

I booked on line and got a fantastic deal of $82-$89 per night. When I called direct and spoke to Emilie to confirm some details she offered to upgrade us (no charge)! She and Theo and Ben and all of the other staff there go out of their way to give you everything you need. The room was cold so they brought me space heaters. Free wine is served every night and they also bring bottles to your room. Can't decide between red or white wine okay take both! I mentioned it was a special occasion and Theo made balloons appear! I can't understand the complaints about the decor -- it's new and clean and has a modern and international flair with a bit of an IKEA/Target/Pier 1 look but if you want leather or antiques go pay $300 a night for it. The bed was comfortable the room was reasonably spacious what more could you want? Yes it borders the tenderloin but so does the downtown area! Don't be scared off it was totally fine. Easy access to transportation parking via the hotel or across the street.

WRONG. The hotel may have a fancy looking outside a stylish lobby and a nice website but the rooms are small and poorly designed.My room was on the 2nd floor. Getting off the elevator (which looks like it was from 30 years ago with a wooden door after the main metal door) you can turn to the left or right. On the right you see a nicer looking hallway with nice red carpet and doors. If you turn to the left (where my room was) you see a cheap looking hallway with old doors 2 shared washrooms and maybe 4 or 5 regular hotel doors. (The ugly wooden ones are for the people who live in the building as permanent residents).Going into my room I saw 2 twin beds which had maybe 1 foot between them maybe even less. A small cramped work desk with nice looking hotel branded papers and a pen (no chair though) and a little armour with a safe and some hangers. No drawers for clothes. The room was the smallest I ever saw. The view from my room was terrible I looked out to window to see a dirty dindgy building.One of the beds was positioned up against the wall right near the air conditioner. Of course I had to open the blinds to get the cool air to enter (it's an in-window air conditioner unit) and the air blew across my bed making it dificult to sleep after waking up at 3am.The next morning I took my stuff and checked into the Novotel on West 52nd street where my friend was going to be staying. I had a great time at the Novotel and will never be returning to th WJ again.The only thing this hotel is good for is for people wanting to stay 1 night have a little nap and leave. If you want a good hotel around that location stay at the Novotel on West 52nd or the Sheraton around that area.As I returned to the hotel the first and last night I stayed there I saw the crew of El Al (Israel Airlines) loading their baggage into a van. Maybe they didn't like it too! Pretty lousy place for a great airline crew of El Al to stay!","2013-09-17T12:35:44","106673.0","0","2013-09-17T12:59:25","ZD111486","Connecticut","1977-01-01T00:00","6726","5.0"

We couldn't agree more with the hotel video describing itself. There is not much elegant about this hotel any longer. And we found it overrated and overpriced unfortunately. Upon entry to the hotel you are greeted with a strong soapy smell that is so disturbing it takes a while to get used to. In addition. it's FAR too edgy for it's historical significance. They made a mistake with the interior decoration when they tried for sleek but ended up with over the top modern with too much black hard edges and smooth surfaces. I wouldn't say it has a warm feeling at all.The concierge was helpful but it always felt like we were encroaching on their time. It's not a type of setup where you can sit down (you're standing the whole time) and chat with the concierge and have them give you ideas. Usually we were expected to know what it is we wanted to do and when.We must not have lucked out on a refurbished room because it was a King Superior but nothing superior about it. It has a sliding glass door with the handle ready to come off at any moment to separate the bathroom from the bedroom. NO privacy whatsoever. A tiny little excuse of a closet inside the bathroom - why? I don't know. I would also add that the cleanliness was not something I would rate highly. There were yellow stains on the white duvet cover. Another annoying feature in the bathroom were the soaps etc. attached to the wall so that if you positioned your hand incorrectly you squirted your clothing!!What I found most interesting were the hidden features in the room. It was a user interface nightmare. The TV had a bizarre remote control that turned the tv off with the record button. The phone in the room was designed to infuriate the most techie of all people (we are both highly technical people a digital user experience designer and engineer) and no instructions on how to call frontdesk or concierge. Then if you wanted coffee why you needed to look inside the boxy night stand of course! Why hadn't I thought of that?The one really great things about the hotel were the free wifi proximity to green park tube station business center and really nice breakfasts (which really should be part of room cost). Other than that it just wasn't worth the money and time.","2013-09-17T13:59:57","129298.0","2","2013-09-17T12:54:17","ZD111604","Florida","1973-01-01T00:00","33530","5.0"

Their restaurant Cafe Andree is excellent but I often just eat in the lounge where I am more comfortable. They also have an excellent wine list.

The weather was very hot getting up to 43 degrees most days and humidity high with a warm during the night. Some days there was a breeze but not enough to cool you down. When we got out of the airport we thought we had made a mistake the heat took our breath away but the next day we found we were soon accustomed to it.We stayed in a Dal-Al Masyaf ocean view Villa. The villa's sit in a brilliant position directly on the beach. A pathway/causeway seperates the villa from the beach. The path either walked or by buggy eventually meanders to the Burg Al Arab. The resort itself is part of the Madinat group of hotels which means luxury where ever you go to. Guests are able to use any of the facilities at the Mina- A-Salam and Al Qsar and the Jumeriah Beach hotels. The resort is huge. All of the hotels are absolutley luxurious. The Al-Qsar and Mina a Salam is surrounded by a waterway. The hotels have about 30 resturants between them. You can get around the resort by taking an Abra a small eletric powered boat or a golf buggy. During the day cold hand towels and fruit sticks are hounded out to guests around the pool and beach.Connecting to the hotels is a Souk full of very quaint shops and fully air conditioned. People are very freindly and nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff who are well trained. The people we spoke to are happy in their roles.All of the shopping malls are fantastic however I found most goods simelar in price to the UK even though it's is supposed to be tax free!! Sales items are the best buys obviously most malls have reduced goods. The Emirates Mall has a 7 storey Ski Slope with real snow the most amazing thing to see. The slopes are visable though a glass wall. This is 5 minutes by taxi.The food in the resturants is very good even if you are dining casually. I recommend seafood which is caught fresh each day and truly delicious. A reasonable meal will cost in the region of •À_50-60 for two people. Most returatnts include gratuity of 10%.We loved the Koubar Bar in the Al Qsar it overlooked the Burg and Jam Base a Jazz club in the Souk. Breakfast is buffet style and there is nothing you cannot get.The sea is crystal clear and like taking a warm bath.It is our second time in Dubai but first time at this resort it is certain we will be returning again next year. We could not fault anything. We are fairly well travelled and have not found service and quality anywhere else the same.We loved it .

The general manager even implied that we were making up a confirmation number! The next day I recognized the woman at the front who had made my reservation and she recalled speaking with me.The first night all 3 of us slept in 1 room as they were completely booked and had tried to have 2 of us switch to a sister hotel. The following morning staff told us that in order to make up for the inconvenience they would give 2 of us the penthouse and that it would be ready at 3:00 PM. When we returned to the hotel we were given a small double room instead.The friend in the single room even had a bellboy awake her by opening the door to her room with a guest in tow!None of us would recommend this hotel.

We found our room a Deluxe Queen on the 11th floor to be adequate if a little on the small side; but having read reviews about NY hotels in general I would probably say it was bigger than expected.Bathroom is nicely appointed if very small for 2 people and some of the detailing wasn't quite what you'd expect from a place with such lavishly decorated public areas.I had breakfast once in the dining area and being a former chef can say that whatever comes out of that kitchen (I had a sneeky peek at dinner service...) would not disgrace a Michelin starred restaurant. It really is that good. The evening Prix Fixe menu at $85 per person for 3 courses Petits Fours and coffee seems outstandingly good value!!!We ate in the Mexican (Ixta) on East 29th and the Chinese next door to that too. Wonderful places both and highly recommended. 28th Street subway is a 1 minute and there is a great deli on the left past the restaurant where we ate sausage (and cheese and egg for the missus) for a couple of bucks a piece.

Why?I tried to check into this hotel early on Dec 13 when I arrived in the city. I picked this hotel because it was near Moscone Ctr and BART and had a reasonable price. This hotel is a haven for foreign flight crews leaving SFO. A flight delay meant that at least myself and the two people in line with me had been bumped from the hotel so these stewardesses could cool their heels for a few more hours. Bonus - they comp'ed my stay at the Fairmont. They gave me a taxi voucher which wasn't accepted to get to the Fairmont. It took them nearly an hour to deal with the mess on their end and another hour to deal with getting up to the Fairmont and checked in there.I came back to the Parc 55 for my second night in the city. The room was nice pretty much unremarkable for this class of hotel in downtown SF. Even on the second go-around the desk staff was very slow.Given all of the problems that I experienced and the I would rather stay at one of the large number of other hotels near Union Square that might actually hold my reservation.","2013-09-17T14:28:05","127261.0","4","2013-09-17T12:11:46","ZD111143","Ohio","2018-01-01T00:00","44662","5.0"

The prices listed at the hotel at the time we checked in were more than double the price we paid online.My partner and I stayed here for a night after a long day in London. Having read previous reviews I was slightly apprehensive about Hyde Park Towers. However I tried to approach it with an open mind and I was very pleasantly surprised!The first plus point is that it is just around the corner from the tube station so it is very convenient. The hotel from outside looks very well kept and reception was welcoming. Staff were very efficient to check us in and the girl who served us seemed friendly (a nice smile) but didn't attempt to make converstation (which was fine by me - I was really tired from the day and was impatient to get to my room in order to relax).Which comes to the room: we were allocated a room on the first floor. The view outside it was... nothing - just another building on the other side and some ventilation vents. (quite expected) Also the room was rather small - just enough for a double bed and some space around it. However they managed to fit in a table with the TV a desk by the bed and a wardrobe. I think given its size they did the best they could. It was pleasant and all we needed. The bed was the highlight of the room - lovely soft cotton sheets and two fluffy pillows - the perfect remedy for my tired body after a day in London.Another thing I was pleased about was the bathroom - although very small (hard to fit two people in there) it was clean and there was a another highlight that I did not expect: a bathtub!The TV was tiny and the reception was not so great but not so bad that we couldn't watch it.Although there have been comments about feeling the underground at the floor we were on the vibrations were minimal and nothing that we couldn't sleep through. So I managed to get a good night's sleep.As for breakfast I don't know what people were complaining about. There was a very good continental breakfast with a good selection of pastries bread jam cereal juices fruit salad... I was very satisfied.Check out was just like check in quick efficient and problem free.One point that put me off a little about the hotel was the region it was in - although the road the hotel was on looked okay I wasn't too comfortable walking around the areas closer to the station. (but this is someone who hardly is in big cities so I am biased and possibly more cautious than most!)I think that overall this is a good place to stay if you need to stay a night in London. However given the size of the room I wouldn't recommend staying here more than a few days. I think it could get quite cramped especially if you have a suitcase.So overall the prices are very competitive online so I would definitely recommend to people on a tight buget and just needs a bed for the night :-)","2013-09-17T15:00:36","140613.0","3","2013-09-17T12:40:35","ZD111132","Oregon","1958-01-01T00:00","97411","5.0"

The general manager even implied that we were making up a confirmation number! The next day I recognized the woman at the front who had made my reservation and she recalled speaking with me.The first night all 3 of us slept in 1 room as they were completely booked and had tried to have 2 of us switch to a sister hotel. The following morning staff told us that in order to make up for the inconvenience they would give 2 of us the penthouse and that it would be ready at 3:00 PM. When we returned to the hotel we were given a small double room instead.The friend in the single room even had a bellboy awake her by opening the door to her room with a guest in tow!None of us would recommend this hotel.

I finally made it to the Palms to check out the Maloof brothers venture..was not overly impressed with the casino areaexpected more of a Strip like quality.I went to the slot club to get a players card and was told that it was Five times points day..Wahooo1 The lady that signed me up said you need 1500 points to get $25 free play. And that the slot points were adjusted already in the machines to reflect the 5 times value. Return on the machines did seem somewhat better than what I encountered on the Strip as I was staying at the Mirage.Took a while to get 1200 points so I put in another $60 figuring I would achieve the 1500 points required to get the $25 free slot play the slot club employee told me about. So after dropping about $180 I finally went to get my $25 I THOUGHT I earned..waited in a line for 25 minutesgot to the counter and said to the gentleman at the counterI finally got the 1500 points required and at least I got the $25 slot play. He put my card in some machine and said to me..I have some bad news for you..you only have 354 points! The five times value points are worth next to NOTHING!!! I told him this was very deceiving and not what I was told when I joined the slot club and the slot machines all showed I now had 1780 points!He then told me..The good news is..You have enough points to get a cap! As for the balance of my points I got a cheque {Which incidentally expires in 24 hours} for sixty eight cents!! What a Con!!..I had friends coming over to join me from The Wynn later that day as we were looking forward to going to the Ghost barand I called their room and told them of my Palms experience and we went to Lavo on the strip instead. Always wanted to check out the Palms as I had heard good things about it a few years back. Beyond disappointing!

Yes they do and it pleasantly fulfilled all my needs for my short stay in Vegas. I arrived late in the evening and was promptly checked in. I was told my non-smoking king wasn't available but I could have a non-smoking dbl and change to a king the next night if I wished. It didn't really matter to me so I stayed in the dbl. The room was clean and nicely appointed in the knotty pine beach look. There were nice toiletries in the bathroom not the generic hotel soap and shampoo and two luggage racks. (How many times have you been in a hotel where one person gets the luggage rack and the other one ends up putting their stuff on the floor?) Pluses: *Concierge-type guy was helpful with info about transportation *On-site restaurant open 24 hrs*Players Club has all kinds of offers and promos (take advantage of it)*It's only a block off The Strip and has bloody reasonable rates!*Being at the end of The Strip there weren't any construction noises as there are further up. Minuses: *No airport shuttle p/u stop. I walked next door to the Tropicana and picked it up there. *Room service didn't come through. I ordered a hamburger at 3 am and waited 40 minutes for the 20 minute delivery. It never showed. Bad customer service [OK for me in the long run. Reeaally needed to sleep off the tequila and beer I drank celebrating the concert I'd seen with my buds :-) ].Overall a nice stay. I'd recommend Hooters to anyone who's looking for a hotel with reasonable rates and doesn't need fountains and a light show out front. It was clean quiet and had everything I needed.","2013-09-17T13:52:30","156614.0","5","2013-09-17T11:36:21","ZD111361","Texas","2012-01-01T00:00","76000","5.0"

The air conditioning system in my room was a disaster : Stop it and some kind of irregular beat would start emerging from it. When on it was quite loud not exactly the sweetest sound to sleep to.

Unless one is staying in a suite somewhere it is a hotel room. View was not great and location is not the best. So one takes taxi or bus (which is convenient) to billion dollar casino corridor. Everyone does a lot of walking anyway so I wouldnt sweat the small stuff and a $8 taxi ride.

Stayed there on an almost sold out weekend of 6/28/08 for one night. As a plat member was upgraded to cool corner room at the checkin (which is more spacious got an extra window balcony to sit on). However was travelling with friends so I requested a fabulous 2 doubles instead no problems.Lobby: The staffs were friendly and efficient the lobby is very hip/chic just like what you would expect at the typical W hotel. I like the hotel ambience espcially at night so pretty. You'll see many people hanging out at the lobby XYZ bars at night time (There's a DJ there too). There's an Acura MDX Experience counter available from noon to 7ish at night everyday which gives you an one-way ride to most of the places in SF area (except airport of course) and we did take advantage of it during our stay. The drivers are friendly and no sales pressure which is an added bonus. But due to the popular demand I recommend reserve your time spot early!The Gym: Very nice with complete sets of eplical machines weights and the swim pool /jacuzzi is right outside of the gym (which is very hip looking too). The gym opens 24/7 but the wet area only opens from 4am to 11pm. Bliss Spa is right across from the gym which is very popular for girls to have their mani/pedicure and other services but I did not get to try it out so I am not going to commend on that.The Room: Some room can be quite noisy at night since they are right next door to a firestation (so for those who hates siren at night you should request a room away from the firestation). Good AC (very quiet) and the lights in the room are very nice too. The bed is the typical W bed not as heavenly as the Westin Heavenly Bed but certainly better than Sheraton Sweet Sleeper and other competitor's bed. I actually bought the pillow and the mattress topper home after I stayed at this hotel since it gave me a really nice sleep. That tells you how much I like their bedding. The room is towards the small size (~300 sq ft?) but still plenty of space for you to store ur luggages n stuff. The shower pressure is good not strong like rainforest but enough to wash you clean. Toiletries is the standard Bliss Sinkside 6 (lemon sage scent) which is one of my favorite hotel product. One thing the bathroom door has no lock and its very clear/see thru!! so be prepared if you are not comfortable with it! This is one of the thing that annoys me the most at this property but hey its W so you need to be more open minded about it. Turndown service available on request every evening.Parking: $42/night 1/2 off if you drive a hybrid. Since its SF I did not drive its just so much easier to travel with their convinent subway system isn't it? Also internet (WiFi) are free at the lobby so you'll bump into many people with their laptop throughout the day.Overall: This is a good well maintained hotel and the renovations gave the room more freshier look instead of the dark depressing color. Some people liked it some don't. Of course the price can be high for most people (at least 200/night) but if you want to have fun meet people or just want to enjoy the W scene you should give this property a try. Don't stay there if you want a QUIET weekend getaway. W is all about fun :D","2013-09-17T13:01:27","121396.0","0","2013-09-17T09:42:27","ZD111576","California","2007-01-01T00:00","94999","5.0"

I have usually had good luck with Priceline name your own price hotel rooms but this hotel was rated a boutique hotel but I'd say is barely a 2-star.To start with we received a TINY room...only a double bed probably about 100-120 sq feet. Furthermore the room was terribly unclean...stains on the linens peeling wallpaper a literally threadbare chair. Worst of all they must have been fixing the place because there was a painters bucket in the middle of our room with a light dusting of plaster and grout all over the floor. It was so late (nearly midnight) that we decided not to gripe and just endured.I didn't have the opportunity to try breakfast because it ended at 9am...on a Sunday. On the bright side the hotel is in a safe central location (near Union Sq but not the Tenderloin) and the staff were all relatively friendly and pleasant. But to me still not worth the money.","2013-09-17T14:20:30","155532.0","-4","2013-09-17T10:01:48","ZD111118","Colorado","1994-01-01T00:00","80221","5.0"

I didn't get to sleep at all because a city garbage truck parked directly under our window with its diesel motor running all night long.The noise and fumes found their way into our stuffy room because we couldn't leave the window open.The second night we had cops in the hallway dragging someone out of the hotel for whatever!The third night we heard a rowdy bunch of drunks celebrating the closing of the near-by bars on Broadway and watched in horror as a pedistrian below was almost gunned down by a car that did not heed the cross walk. He was so angry that he almost dragged the old lady out of her car to beat her. We never missed any thing that went on three floors below us or in the rooms next to ours. The walls were so thin. The neighborhood so loud. The traffic so constant.The microwave oven worked sometimes...the refrigerator keep our italian liquor ice cold ...the shared bath rooms were adequate...the immediate neighborhood was marginal and for the $150.00 price for two people in a tourist double room the St. Paul hotel was a real adventure and could certainly use some divine intervention from its namesake.","2013-09-17T11:35:11","133737.0","-5","2013-09-17T10:07:12","ZD111425","Florida","1996-01-01T00:00","33690","5.0"

This is of course completely ridiculous. There is no game other than the wandering oryxs and some small buck. It is perhaps the fault of the hotel that is comes armed with genuine South African rangers who greet you on arrival...maybe that raises the expectation.

If that is what you are looking for then you can come join yourself to the trendy set at the hotel's bar/lounge without submitting yourself to the other inconveniences of the Hotel. My sister &amp; I stayed at The W and we were disappointed in the rooms and the staff.Our rooms were extremely small and cramped. And no place to put our folded clothes except in our suitcase's and then no room for the suitcases to be out in the open. The closets were behind the entrance/exit door to the room and were difficult to reach back into.There was an incident where for 3 nights in a row someone in a room adjacent to ours would decide to have a party at 2:00 am and we complained to the management but they failed to resolve the issue. It did not stop until the guest checked out of the hotel. The management did not want to compensate us for the lack of sleep. Their attitude was that since we did not change rooms then they felt that they were not responsible for the inconvenience that it created for us.When we checked out at the end of our week long stay we found that we were being charged for items that had been in the mini bar. We explained that we NEVER consumed any items out of the mini bar and that our only contact with the mini bar was to keep some of our personal food item's stored there for the refrigeration. They did remove those charges for the mini bar but only after a lengthy unharmonious discussion.There was one shinning star [10 star value] in the Hotel and that was ONE of the female concierge's. She was a dream come true in that she was very knowledgeable about how to get around in the city without having to rely solely on taxis. And she even gave us her personal hotel number to call if we got lost or needed more help while we were out. She gave us great restaurant advise and sent us to affordable walking distance restaurants that we enjoyed very much.On my next trip to NYC I will look elsewhere for accommodations in the Union Square area.","2013-09-17T14:15:08","113240.0","-3","2013-09-17T09:39:33","ZD111449","Illinois","1963-01-01T00:00","60129","5.0"

I generally wonder what the quality testers Leading Hotels writes in ervery newsletter of the Leaders Club about are doing when they are checking a bad facility like this?- Room 4506 generelly needs to be refurbished in the bathroom. - There was no minibar available. In the bathroom (!!!) was an old icy but empty refrigerator which was disgusting. - The alarm clock didn't work but was repaired at the first evening. - The turn-down simply was forgotten the first evening the blanked I moved away was dirty at several parts. - The turn-down the second night only put the dirty blanket away. The curtain wasn't close and the paper basket wasn't emptied. - A pressing service at the later evening wasn't possible the pressing utilities in the room were old damaged and dirty. - There were no frottee-slippers available. The housekeeping told me to contact the concierge the concierge told me to contact the housekeeping. Together they told me I should buy some slippers next morning in the gift shop. I needed the sleepers because of the ugly bathroom and carpet in the room and so I decided to step out to the neighboured Ritz-Carlton asking them for frottee-slippers. I appollogized that I was staying in a Leading Hotel and got the slippers complimentary within two minutes in the typical Ritz Carlton charming way. - There was one bell man for storing luggage in the lobby - seven (!) guests were waiting for service and complaining. I won't stay there anymore.","2013-09-17T12:34:19","148881.0","0","2013-09-17T10:26:06","ZD111470","Kansas","1982-01-01T00:00","67214","5.0"

This Hotel is very cheap and very central. If you are going to Vegas on a budget and do not mind a walking then I would recommend this hotel. It is acroos the road from NY NY and the MGM. But if you plan on going to see shows in Mirage like we did everynight then it can be a bit of a task walking up there. Also if you are a fan of the fast foods there are many on the 2nd floor. Not everyones pick but again if you are in town on a budget. We got a standard room cheapest in tower 1. It was grand. Very clean with all the basics you need. Window was looking into center of hotel so no view but no noise either. Now the Bad.1. Time share people We go a short taxi from the airport. Striaght as we got in the door we were catch by some time share people who were offering us free ticket after 22 hours travelling we were fooled into going to a time share presentation which lasted 3 hours and is the biggest scam in the world. We did get half price show tickets though. Not every hotel has time share people but the cheap ones do. But ignore them the first time and then tell them that you are booked to go when ever they ask.2. Smokey Bar Casino. As you can still smoke in bars and casinos in Vegas you may find it hard to take if you are a none smoker and not used to smoke indoors. Excalibur was the most smokeist casino on the strip. Summary if your going to Vegas on a budget this is the place to stay. Do no stay at Circus Circus long walk from the main strip and walking with dirt.If I had more cash and wanted a more pleasured stay I would stay at caesars palace.","2013-09-17T13:03:50","148448.0","1","2013-09-17T09:53:40","ZD111522","Maryland","1991-01-01T00:00","20837","5.0"

I stayed in Affinia 50 155 East 50th St with my friend for 5 nights from 14/9/08 and it was indeed like coming home. The concierge staff were extremely helpful and in particular Rome and Manny to whom nothing was a problem. Rome was very attentive and made sure to greet us by name each day which gave us that feeling of being welcomed home! As expected based on Trip Advisor reviews the hotel did not disappoint. The rooms are spacious and clean with very comfy beds. The bathroom is quite small but that is a minor detail. Having the kitchen was a bonus as we could prepare our light breakfast each day (tea &amp; toast) but should you have wanted to the facilities were good enough to prepare a full meal! No need to do that however as there are many excellent restaurants and delis on the doorstep. Highly recommended are PAX for lunch to either eat in or take out and for evening meal Mama Mexico both of which are very close by. Be sure however to take advantage of the wine and cheese available in the hotel each evening between 6-7pm on level 2. Lifts did not always stop for us instead they whizzed by on occasion we were on 6th floor but it was not a huge problem. The hotel's location is excellent being close to Grand Central The Rock and 5th Avenue. It's also easy to walk to Central Park which offers a pleasant change from all the buzz of the city. This hotel certainly lives up to it's expectations and is highly recommended I certainly look forward to a welcome home in the not too distant future!","2013-09-17T12:19:46","149011.0","-2","2013-09-17T11:32:09","ZD111291","North Carolina","1982-01-01T00:00","28309","5.0"

It has a really good view. Maybe not on the floor that you have. It is a big place. The rooms are big. It does have a pool. It is nice and chilly. The bedroom is big. The breakfast has delicious stuff. I liked the bacon and the toast. It's not far away from lots of stuff. It is from some stuff but not much. If you have kids the pool liked I talked about would be really good fun. Scarlett (aged 5)We stayed for 3 nights in a two bedroom apartment and booked on expedia.com for AU$320 / 3 nights. One bedroom had two big singles the other a small double. We decided to push the singles together and then made up a bed with the couch cushions for one of our two children. The apartment is large and clean - decor is basic but fine. It was good to have some space after being used to all cramming into one hotel room. The staff are not particularly friendly. Breakfast is okay - with many asian choices eggs to order a small selection of fruits and cereals and toast. We didn't use the kitchen as eating is so cheap. The hotel delivers a complimentary 3 gallon bottle of fresh water which we appreciated. They also have a self-service laundry and we did a huge wash and dry for only 45yuan - another great service on offer. We found this task had been very difficult in Beijing - so it was great to have clean clothes. They are doing some renovation work at the moment which disturbed us a little during the night. There was no mention of this at booking or check-in. We liked that the hotel is on a very typical Shanghai street - with all the aromas and colour of real life. We walked to major shopping areas despite the intense heat and it was nice to return home to a well air-conditioned place and the pool as well. My husband had his hair cut at a place opposite the hotel for 10 yuan (AU$1.80). We used their 24 hours of internet in the room but on check out were billed for two days - because the 24 hours covered noon- noon. This was very annoying as it was not explained at all when we organized it and we were very careful not to use beyond the 24 hour period. I would recommend this hotel if you want to save money yet have a spacious comfortable and quite well-located spot with a family.","2013-09-17T12:36:58","117424.0","-5","2013-09-17T10:46:17","ZD111586","North Carolina","1976-01-01T00:00","28016","5.0"

This was the greeting we and many others suffered on arrival at the front desk of the SF Westin Market street property. We were in SF for a professional meeting that I had scheduled in September; we reserved and paid in full for our room on Sepember 30th through WWTE (an Expedia affiliate). We were told that the Hotel had decided to cancel resevations randomly based on use paterns due to a overbooking situation that they claimed was due to a technical error.Tthey had informed Expedia of the cancelations expecting them to notify those cancelled. The hotel had overbooked 60-80 rooms and did not discover it untill a week or two prior to the meeting.The Hotel denied any responsibility for notifying us of their decision nor did they feel the situation was up for negotiation even though they had accepted payment in full over five months earlier. We were left at the front desk with the offer of alternative housing at an airport area hotel for the same price 30-45 minutes away. There was no negotiation for us just I'm sorry there is nothing else we can do you have been cancelled and reassigned to the airport hotel;we may offer you a complimentry one night stay here in the future. We were not alone in this situatuion as others came from a great distance and got the same message some from the UK that had no other options but to accept such poor treatment. We were all informed at the front desk and left in the lobby; we were abandonded and disrespected by the management of this hotel. They let their front desk people do the painful task of informing the guests of their decision and then taking the reaction in a public place while they sat in thier offices. We have stayed at many Starwood properties in the past (including this specific hotel in December 07) and have been pleased with their quality and service but his was our worst travel experience .","2013-09-17T13:20:42","114325.0","-2","2013-09-17T11:54:23","ZD111297","Pennsylvania","1998-01-01T00:00","19067","5.0"

Who doesn't love hearing that! I booked a Cityview Premier King under the Rough Draft opening rate. The upgrade was to a 14th floor suite.... but overlooking the river. I appreciated the upgrade but after a number of visits to NYC we'd never had a city view (usually a brick wall view). Michelle at the front desk seamlessly changed us to an 11th floor Cityview Jr. Suite. We didn't regret giving up a larger suite for this room--it had GREAT unobstructed views of Times Square overlooking 11th Ave. (however the hotel is JUST at the wrong angle to see recognizable buildings like the Empire State or Rockefeller Center)Oh.. and the bellman was incredibly friendly and apologetic after we entered the 14th floor suite to see it was 1. a river-front (which wasn't what we'd wanted) AND 2. that housecleaning still hadn't refreshed it from the previous guest! The staff is definitely the star of the hotel--even if they're just passing you or waiting at the elevator with you they're striking up a natural unforced conversation.After staying at the Hudson Hotel (near Columbus Circle) a number of times with their postage-stamp sized bathroom it was great having a double sink shower AND tub. (The shower alone at Ink was the size of the Hudson's entire bathroom).I've seen complaints here about ink 48's location. We found it GREAT! You walk down 48th street and in a few blocks you're right in the middle of Times Square. We were in the city for a concert at MSG--we walked to and from there. We walked another day up to Rockefeller Center then up 5th Avenue and through Central Park (up to 72nd street). It was also great to walk through neighborhoods like Hell's Kitchen instead of staying directly in the midst of tourist central. We stopped into quite a few local neighborhood stores (read: they didn't carry I heart NY shirts!) It was a great taste of local flavor. Although I didn't get a chance to utilize it this visit I liked the runner's map they had to show you great routes and distance markers along the river bike path for 2 3 or 6 mile runs.The complimentary breakfast (bagels croissants coffee and juice) was a nice move.Room for improvement: The room rate was supposedly 48% off for the rough draft opening. I booked for two nights at $265 a night. I think charging $500-$700 per night that I'm seeing on their rate calendar is simply insane. I've stayed at a Ritz-Carlton for MUCH less than their non-discounted rates. And although it's a nice hotel it's NO Ritz-Carlton. They need to revise their full-price rates to be realistic. Although I have no complaints about service or accommodations $265 is hands-down the most I'd spend to stay there again...and $265 is hitting the ceiling of what I'd pay.Also small complaint: we could hear our neighbors raise and lower their blinds. it seems that to accommodate large windows the walls are thinner near the window area. Nothing worse than hearing neighbors next door to ruin the feelings of privacy in your room!I parked on my own at a garage a block away (at 49th St and 10th ave.) for $27 per day. I did that because I couldn't see the valet rate on their website. ... A good move considering another reviewer said valet was $65 per day. I'm sure with that $65 rate the valet probably parked cars in the same garage that I was in!And I agree with another reviewer who commented about the water bottle. The last few hotels I've stayed (and of comparable price points) have offered free bottled water. it seems to be a trend now in hotels. At Ink 48 there was a liter of Poland Springs on the shelf next to two glasses. Totally not even near the mini-bar. We thought it was complimentary... until on our last day I looked at the mini-bar price list and saw that it was $7. They should put a note ON the bottle instead of burying the price in the snack drawer.To summarize: Great hotel. Super friendly staff top-to-bottom moderately spacious for NYC hotels with great views of city and river/NJ. The 48% off rate is what they should charge all the time. $65 valet per day is off the charts insane. I'd stay there again if I got a rate comparable to (or slightly less than) what I paid last weekend.","2013-09-17T14:51","138545.0","-1","2013-09-17T09:25:10","ZD111552","South Carolina","1972-01-01T00:00","29577","5.0"

Although the room I booked on-line came back as not available on my confirmation - even though they still took my money and I still had a reservation - when I called they promised me it would be okay. True to their word it WAS and check-in was very smooth having used their advance on-line feature they had e-mailed me. The room size was nice with good amenities but no safe in the room. -The whole room had a wierd problem with screws that were missing or very loose (hall door handle tv cabinet closet etc.) The bathroom was roomy and clean with nice features. -After we cleared up the $179 they charged me for the mini-bar we had not used we had a good stay at a fair price in a very convenient location on the river near Michigan Ave. and Millenium Park and close enough to the Navy Pier.","2013-09-17T11:43:48","144996.0","1","2013-09-17T13:02:38","ZD111412","Texas","2005-01-01T00:00","79110","5.0"

We kept repeating that mantra the whole time we stayed here. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite overlooking the Thames Parliament Buildings and Big Ben. What a wonderful view both day and night. The suite had everything you could ask for including a washer/dryer in the kitchen. The hardwood floor in the living room is amazing. All the staff from reception to the manager to the restaurant went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We ate dinner twice in the hotel restaurant Chino Latino. Kind of unique sort of a grazing menu. The first night we focused on the sushi and sashimi. Yum. The hotel could do with more staff at breakfast. I think they rely on everyone taking the buffet (which is pretty pricey) and so if you order a la carte prepare for a wait. We have never stayed on the south bank before but it is as centrally located as anywhere. The bus stop for The Original Tour (buy your tickets from the concierge) is just down the street at Lambeth Palace. We have already booked a return visit in May at which time we hope to explore this side of London a bit more.","2013-09-17T13:47:41","146555.0","0","2013-09-17T11:56:34","ZD111314","Virginia","2017-01-01T00:00","22060","5.0"

Anyway we were supposed to have the family suite for about $180.00 a night and she said that she could give us a room at their sister property Broadway manor for $140.00 a night. As i was talking to her I looked on their website and saw I could get a room for 3 of those nights for $59.00 a night  1 night for $99 which she later gave me the discount but if I had not asked we would have been paying a couple extra hundered for our stay.Instead of staying in a family suite that we booked months in advance in a hotel that we picked because of tripadvisor we were packed in a standard room of a lower rated hotel. We would have stayed elsewhere but it was a high volume week and we could not get anything reasonable on such short notice.(I'm sure they got a lot more money for the suite). Being pretty mad about this I started checking other reviews and I realized that if you change the tripadvisor search to lowest rated instead of newest every person who gave this hotel a 1 did so because they were duped out of their reservation. The funny thing is this is the only hotel I have seen with a 48 hour cancellation policy instead of 24.I can only rate this hotel a 1 even though I'm sure it's alright once you actually get a room but as Seinfield once said  taking the reservation is easy it's actually about holding the reservation. Roll the dice if you want just have a backup plan. Would love to hear a response from management!","2013-09-17T12:15:40","124634.0","3","2013-09-17T12:45:34","ZD111134","Virginia","1959-01-01T00:00","23322","5.0"

The service was really good from the moment we stepped into the hotel to our checkout. The twin rooms we occupied were a standard for our first stay and an executive for the return trip. Both types of rooms were good and spacious. The beds were comfortable but the mattresses were thinner than some of the other Hilton hotels we stayed in the USA. The bathroom in the standard room had a glass door in place of a shower curtain and one had to push out the glass door in order to step in or out of the tub. It appeared a bit tricky initially to whether to push the glass door in or out of the tub and how to support oneself after a shower. However once we got over the first shower it was alright. In the executive room there was a separate shower and a bathtub.Just an observation though not a problem for us ( we sleep late at night) was one evening we heard footsteps coming from above our executive room on the 13th floor. On checking we found that our room was below some private rooms in the corridor next to the 14th floor executive lounge. If you are a light sleeper avoid being assigned those few rooms.The staff we encountered from the people manning the concierge desk reception executive lounge and ground floor restaurant were not only helpful friendly and warm toward us but were also perceived to be nice and helpful to each other. People could be professional and go about doing their jobs but the staff here appeared to be really working as a team. At the reception area one evening I saw a guest who had just arrived being greeted warmly by a staff member from the concierge desk. However the guest was really rude and ignored the staff member who just smiled and went back to the desk. I thought that encounter was handled very well by the staff member who probably did not take it personally.There was a good spread for breakfast and lots of fruits during our stay. There was access to the Executive Lounge throughout the day until 11 pm with snacks drinks and free internet access when we stayed in the executive room.The DLR South Quay is situated next to the hotel and is convenient for trips to the Docklands area. The Tube is about 5 to 7 minutes walk away... a short walk from the hotel over a footbridge and into Jubilee Place and across the road to the station to take the Jubilee Line. The short walk was more enjoyable on days when it was not so windy. On windy days we took the DLR from South Quay to Heron Quays just one stop away and changed to the Tube or vice versa on coming back to the hotel. This was because we used the Oyster cards which allowed us to make unlimited trips capped at a certain amount daily. The DLR stations are not manned and one must not forget and just get on the train without tapping the card at the Touch In/Out buttons. We were also told to place the card over the Touch in/out button at the DLR stations for at least 2 seconds for it to register when one of our cards did not validate at the South Quay DLR station.The location of the hotel is quiet away from noise and crowd of Central London. It is a fairly long ride by Dot2Dot to and from Heathrow Airport but we enjoyed the sightseeing along the way.","2013-09-17T13:08:32","130812.0","5","2013-09-17T12:57:17","ZD111490","Washington","1964-01-01T00:00","98587","5.0"

I guess I can see why someone would consider this nce if they have never stayed in a suite hotel before or have had a bad experience in the past. I would only spend $100 CAD here. I have been a part of Tripadvisor for a while now but this is the first time I felt that I needed to speak out about this hotel so others are not mislead like I was.The picture gallery of all the picures I've found on the internet showed this hotel being really nice. Good thing about this hotel: nice lobby free breakfast free high speed internet if you have your own laptop. The parking is tight with columns dividing every space so you must be careful driving your car in. Good thing about parking is that there are elevators in the parking lot that goes straight up to your floor ONLY ON PARKING LEVELS 2 AND 5. The living room space is only the size of the sofabd. The linen is old pillow case are washed but pilows are NOT and they smell. We open the balcony and there is water leaking from who knows where. If you have young children becareful because there are spaces in the balcony---the walls of the balcony are not attached to each other. The washrooms are too tight for a suite and for the hallway everyone can hear what you say in your suite! I've read on the internet that Old Montreal is about 30 mins walkign distance but the front desk says dont' walk it take the subway because it is too far.

I am still on the fence. I am a rewards member and find Marriotts to be consistent and one of my preferred brrands. The Marquis is just average. Frankly - for a family its got everything you need - but its just too big. The elevators have to be keyed into your floor and then they tell you which elevator to wait for - I was on the 34th floor in a large corner king suite - great view and great space - but this hotel is like a mini city itself - that dumps out into the extremely busy Times Square - I like my travel to be a little more low key and intimate. The staff were quite friendly and accomodating - but it is a little unnerving that the trunks of all cars and cabs are inspected as you pull up - of course you are reminded of the terror strikes at Marriotts at other parts of the world and are comforted knowing Marriott takes safety seriously but it really emphasizes the size of this facility. I ate at the View restaraunt at the top that rotates around for a full view of the city - not only was the environment lovely the meal was better than I expected for a fixed priced 3 course menu. I liked the many amenities here including an incredible fitness center bars restaurants Starbucks you name it . . but if you are looking for more personal experience quiet and ease of travel - look at a smaller hotel off of Times Square.","2013-09-17T15:12:20","151053.0","0","2013-09-17T09:22:19","ZD111133","California","1986-01-01T00:00","93007","5.0"

Pack accordingly and prepare yourself to do battle with the oh so stylish but impracticalities at this place such as 1) a flashlight so you can see in the dimly lit hallways that were cool in the 90s but we're over it now; 2) a book reading light otherwise you have to haul yourself out of bed to turn off the light when reading in bed; 3) an electric kettle - inconceivalble that a place that charges this much doesn't offer them. It cost me $43 to have one delivered to the room and came with one tea cup 4 tea bags and a sugar bowl - not even a cookie. Fortnum &amp; Mason here I come!; 4) an extension cord so you can plug your gear into sockets located at floor level and not have to use your computer while sitting on the floor nor dry your hair in the same position; 5) a small hammer so you can fully depress the button to flush the toilet and a nail repair kit so you can fix the nails you broke trying to depress the oh so stylish button without the hammer; 6) determination to get past the doormen at night who ask for your name on a list to go into the lobby - or just grease them with a 20 pound note - this is what those who weren't on the list appeared to be doing during my visit; 7) slippers as those marble floors in the bathroom are very cold in winter; 8) willingness to be an exhibitionist while you are in the room as the glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom give you a great view of the neighbors both day and night and vice versa as well as a traveling companion (let's hope you are very very close) while you use the shower and the loo in full view ; 9) a luggage rack or just don't bring much with you as the suitcase will end up on the floor taking up the path that goes around the free-floating bed in the middle of the room; 10) a rubber door stopper to keep the maids from barging in - those Do Not Disturb signs don't show up well in the very dark hallways. Thankfully the hotel provides ok toiletries and lots of plush towels to mop up the water that oozes out onto the oh so stylish flush-with-the-floor glass-walled shower. Call ahead for a showercap to be placed in the many shower-only rooms - who would think that someone might need one and they could be placed in the rooms automatically.Restaurant service is brusque with the black-clad waitresses constantly interrupting and one told us to cash out in the midst of a meal as she was leaving her shift and needed to get paid! On the positive side the hotel is very well located on a fairly quiet street the concierges were very helpful regarding restaurant suggestions and the day shift door men adept at giving directions and finding taxis.Great place for a wild weekend with a hot date but not very practical for business travelers or those who expect the basics to be covered. If you go to mingle with the trendy crowd Increase the odds that you and your paramour will get into the bar at night - check in on a weekday!","2013-09-17T13:55:42","104390.0","-1","2013-09-17T12:50:27","ZD111450","Florida","2009-01-01T00:00","33031","5.0"

The original lobby has been turned in to the Garden Court restaurant.The room was small by modern standards. Would have felt claustrophobic if it weren't for the high ceilings giving the illusion that the room is bigger. A luggage rack was available to place one suitcase but then there wasn't enough space in the room for a second without having to use the 1 seat and ottoman. The closet was even smaller. While there were adequate and apppropriate hangars (wooden with bar wooden with clips padded) the closet space was really enough for just one person. And no the second luggage would not have fit.The bathroom was equally small. Two people could not get ready in the bathroom at the same time. Additionally no fan was available so we had to air out the bathroom between showers.Because my travel companion was in the wedding party he had to rent a car. Parking is only available as valet for $48 a day! Locally there were a few garages but none remained open through the weekend so you could not retrieve your car.Prices within the hotel were outrageous. Chips and salsa with the room service fee and automatic gratuity came out to $15. (we declined to order). High speed internet service was $15.99 a day. Then printing 2 pages was over $5.The staff and service were courteous and competent but nothing spectacular.While we appreciate the cost of luxury we also expect value and did not feel we received that.

The hotel seemed OK from the website and reviews so I thought I'd give it a try for an overnight stay in Montreal. The front desk experience was OK although I was sure that the Travelocity reservation mentioned a complementary continental breakfast but the front desk person said that they didn't have one. The room itself was quite worn and my wife said that the carpet was dirty. The ice machine down the hall had its front hanging on by its hinges and the dispenser was held together by what looked like caulking (probably some sort of adhesive but it certainly wasn't done with care). The pool was OK and a decent size but shallow. When leaving in the morning they had the entrance to the front of the hotel blocked off to cars for some unknown reason so I had to circle around and re-enter through the pay parking lot (but I didn't have to pay; it was just a pain). If I had paid $120 I would have been very unhappy. At $84 I was OK. If I could have given it a 2.5 rating instead of 3 I would have. Would I recommend it to a friend though?

I have been a part of Tripadvisor for a while now but this is the first time I felt that I needed to speak out about this hotel so others are not mislead like I was.The picture gallery of all the picures I've found on the internet showed this hotel being really nice. Good thing about this hotel: nice lobby free breakfast free high speed internet if you have your own laptop. The parking is tight with columns dividing every space so you must be careful driving your car in. Good thing about parking is that there are elevators in the parking lot that goes straight up to your floor ONLY ON PARKING LEVELS 2 AND 5. The living room space is only the size of the sofabd. The linen is old pillow case are washed but pilows are NOT and they smell. We open the balcony and there is water leaking from who knows where. If you have young children becareful because there are spaces in the balcony---the walls of the balcony are not attached to each other. The washrooms are too tight for a suite and for the hallway everyone can hear what you say in your suite! I've read on the internet that Old Montreal is about 30 mins walkign distance but the front desk says dont' walk it take the subway because it is too far.

Though most things have been said in previous entered reviews I like to add a few things.My first stay was in the week of christmas in 2006. Together with a friend we had a twinroom for about 4 nights. We got a really good deal via a website that I can't remember right now and payed 120 euro per night!! As I payed almost that exact amount for a single room on another visit I'd say this is certainly a good deal!When you enter the hotel the first thing you notice is the smell! They have done a lot of things to give the place a warm and comfortable atmosphere. Lot's of details. And if that's your thing this is your hotel don't expect a modern hightech hotel with elevators etc. (yes the stairs are narrow but really not exceptional giving that it is an old building).The first nice thing we discovered in our room was a bottle of champagne! It was a present because they wouldn't clean the rooms on christmasday. We loved the room if I had to say one bad thing is that it was quite cold and the little heater couldn't help that.Someone has already described this room accurately and placed pictures so I'm gonna leave at this.My second visit was in december 2007 for just one night. The room I got was nr. 27 and it was lovely! As you can see on the pictures it had a romantic theme that I loved very much.The bed was nice roomtemperature comfortable plenty of tea/coffee clean kitchenette and clean bathroom. Yes the showers are very tiny one needs to concider if you're somewhat larger. All in all I loved this room very very much and wished I could have stayed longer.This time I ordered a breakfast. For 5 pound you'll get 2 pastries 2 yoghurts juice and 2 pieces of fruit. Not bad for that price from the looks of it the staff doesn't make any profit from this and really sees it as an extra service.The staff is always very nice. This time I had to reschedule my reservation to another date and when I emailed them this it was no problem at all. They always have a smile on their face and are very helpfull and up for a chat. The rooms are ready very early -as someone else stated- which is something I found to be exceptional compared to other hotels that let you wait till 3 or 4 in the afternoon.One last thing about the area cause I see people writing about not liking it too much; to me it's my favourite area of London. And I am a single young woman travelling alone a lot so I hope that accounts for something:) It's in a very quiet neighbourhood near to Westbourn grove and Whiteley's shopping centre. Queensway really isn't too bad its multicultural and if you're not used to that it may shock you but all in all I've never seen anything that might be a reason to be scared.And last but not least it's near Hydepark what more do you want!I've already recommended this hotel to lots of people and will continue doing that!","2013-09-17T12:44:38","112058.0","-5","2013-09-17T12:37:34","ZD111145","Illinois","2006-01-01T00:00","60620","5.0"

The Picadilly line gets you to Earls court then you can catch the District line but the day we were there it was out and we had to get a bus. Even if the Dsitrict line is running it's only offering 1 train every 25 minutes or so. You may walk up to Kensington High Street but you will have to change again to get anywhere. I haven't been to London for a while but prices have jumped like crazy. The room service breakfast was over 45$ USD per PERSON for a cooked b'fast. The internet for 1 x day was over $27USD.

One day the room service hadn't left us towels but the receptionist gave them immediately after informing him about it.We got a triple room instead of double one. Obviously it has more space than the double room. The room was next to the stairs therefore the noises were a bit too easy to hear through the door.

So you have to be a little suspicious going into it. We kept our expectations low and ended up satisfied with what we got. For the price we knew we weren't going to have lavish decor and plush linens. The rooms are spartan and no-frills but they are clean and adequately sized. The bathrooms have small bars of soap but no other toiletries so be prepared and bring your own. If you're a light sleeper this may not be the place to stay. Street traffic can be heard at all hours as well as the bass beat of the music playing at the club across the street. We brought a travel fan and it helped drown out a lot of the extraneous noise late at night.For the location and the price the Ohio House is hard to beat.

Not very friendly more suited to their traffic control function than customer service. Lots of them but dysfunctional.Pleasant check-in lady at the reception desk but no-one to show us to our room.Room was good with all the usual facilities of a $800suite but nothing sensational. No large flat screen TVs furnishings not opulent but ok.Club concierge was useless throughout our stay. When asked for tickets for either a ballet opera or classical performance simply turned to the internet. as you or I could have done. Failed to find any tickets but their ticket agent had more joy but by the time they got back to them to confirm they had gone. (There was no need to check back with me I had left clear instructions to buy tickets).Calling the concierge was impossible voicemail.. ringing out.. answered and cut off.. answered and put on hold..Trying to organise a car to take me back to the airport was challenging enough for them - had to repeat my instructions 3 times before they understoon - then they still got it wrong... see later.Staff knocking on the hotel door despite the do not disturb sign - very irritating.No turndown service despite a specific call (at 8pm) requesting one. Called to ask for mineral water (as is normally left on a turndown) - an hour later (midnight!) the housekeeper turned up to do the turndown!On check out bell man tried to give me tags for my stored luggage. I explained that the car organised by the hotel would collect the bags ahead of collecting me from a restaurant for the onward journey to the hotel. He said I'd have to give the tags to the concierge and tutted and sighed when I asked him to pass them to the concierge for me.When the car came to pick me up it only had 4 bags on board not the 5 they had collected from my room. Had to go back to the hotel where the staff were very apologetic and accepted responsibility for the mistake.. but nevertheless I was now running late.So maybe I sound picky.. but in my books its the service and the attention to detail that distinguish an expensive hotel from a great hotel.The Ritz-Carlton is expensive but the service is a big let down. Again lots of staff around the place but all seem disorganised and many unwilling.Until they get their staff more organised stay at the Mandarin.","2013-09-17T14:53:03","120741.0","-1","2013-09-17T11:42:41","ZD111256","Massachusetts","1949-01-01T00:00","2062","5.0"

In that room you may be treated to a huge mosquito eater smashed into the wall above the television and a broken room heater like we were. No heat wouldn't have been a big problem except it was winter during a major cold snap. We moved to another room where the heater worked a little bit but only after being made to wait for maintenance to come pull the unit apart to see if he could fix it first. This was at 10p.m. mind you and I was bundled up in a cashmere trench sweatjacket and a wool beanie trying to get warm. Most hotels would have just switched us immediately considering the late hour but not Cathedral Hill.  When the maintenance man pulled the filter off the ancient unit it was so encrusted with filth I wouldn't have known what it was if he hadn't told me. He was nice enough to go check another room to see if the heater worked. Then he called the front desk told them to move us and left the new rooms heater on so it would be ready for us. It's pretty sad that the maintenance man has to call and bully the front desk into moving us like they should have done in the first place but I'm grateful for his assistance. The room wasn't fantastic but at least there were no visible dead things and there was some heat.The strange thing is my husband and I stayed at this hotel a few months prior and were given a nicer room for less money. We liked it enough to choose it again for this latest trip. We wont make that mistake again. A man in the elevator the next morning told us the Hotel is scheduled to be torn down in a couple of years to make way for a new hospital.

Thick heavy cigar smoke permeated the sheets and air. Disgusting and ridiculous. We go back downstairs and the manager gives us another room. Again this is for a 650$ a night room. The elevator has a card reader so you cannot ascend unless you insert your room key. Fine. I understand security but it does not work most of the time. Breakfast is also extra!

But the room was also rather chilly partly because the window was fully open at the time of arrival but at least it had been closed by the time I arrived back at the room later that evening although I still had to go down to hunt for a duvet which was not present. With luck the desk clerk was able to find one but that was a strange oversight in the first place. Even more disturbing (along with such local idiosyncracies like the need to lock the door with the key after closing it -- at least nothing became unaccounted for...) was the loosely clanging door between this and the room next door which of course did nothing to improve the already non-existent soundproofing between the rooms. The bathroom and room itself were spotless and with a more modern Scandinavian touch but with the temperature inside both also more akin to Swedish Lapland in autumn (without mosquitoes). For the hotel's somewhat demanding name as well as for the price -- although far from especially expensive for London but nevertheless the most expensive in my whole trip -- one might be tempted to expect a bit more than was the case.=Location: Rather nice just off Hyde Park and with excellent connections to surface and sub-surface transport. Along a picturesque colonnaded terrace that can also make finding the hotel a bit difficult the first time.=Other: Steel-encased elevator (nice) and the infuriating motion controlled automatically-turning-off corridor lighting (not nice). No complimentary refreshments (along the accommodation concept).=Personnel: Friendly and helpful young personnel which nevertheless could do only so much to overcome some of the oversights.=Verdict: No-frills living quarters with the back-packer-friendly kitchenette amenities -- a somewhat chilly experience in a modernly decorated but dubiously soundproofed double.","2013-09-17T13:23:21","126588.0","-1","2013-09-17T12:19:48","ZD111359","New Hampshire","1954-01-01T00:00","3769","5.0"

Ya can't beat that price. We got a bed and bathroom all you need in Vegas. The room was clean. The elevators were fast. The buffet for 8 bucks was edible. The gaming was ok. Go to the back bar feed 20 bucks into the video poker machine and get fed drinks one right after another. We would tip a buck on every drink....the bar tender would be there with another before you were done.Downside? Yep. The tub had some drainage issues....it would slowly fill up with water as you showered. Oh well....your feet would get a nice soaking!! Not a big deal. The heat/ac worked fine. The room was cleaned daily. The beds were ok and so were the pillows.If you were on the east side (facing fremont st.) it would be noisy at the top of the hour with the light show. The last one is at midnight. Then again...you aren't in the room anyway...right?Honestly you are never in your room except to sleep a little take a shower and go back out!! For this price...you can't beat the hotel.We stayed at the Strat the last time. Didn't like it. Too far away from everything. The strip would be ok but pricey to stay and pricey to gamble. The Fremont Street Experience was fun. Plenty of good casinos within a very short walking distance. Quick bus trip to the other end of the strip. Only a $20 taxi ride if you want to go that route.Looking for good food? The buffet at the plaza was ok. The Main Street is better....just a couple of blocks away. Check out the diner at the Golden Gate. You can get a $7 8oz prime rib meal that is actually very good.Get bored with one casino...just walk across the street or down one and hit another. The Viva Las Vegas show at the Plaza is kind of cheesy but fun. Get a players card and get a pass for a free show. Great afternoon entertainment. Catch the Defending the Caveman show at the Nugget. Very entertaining. Check out 1/2 price tickets in front of the Four Queens. Be sure to hit the Big Elvis show at Bills Saloon (formerly the Barbary Coast)...great show. Get there early to get a seat. Gotta spend $5 for a drink. Catch the Mac King show at Harrah's. Great entertainment for the dollar. Look for a deal though....we paid full price and didn't get a drink.The light show is fun and changes every hour.Check in is kind of hard to get to. Gotta go to the 3rd floor then walk toward Laughlin. Just kidding....but you have to trek a ways to get checked in. The first room we had was already occupied...good thing they weren't in there at the time....wouldn't that have been something?? No lock box in the room to keep your gambling money safe. With some sharp thinking...you can easily find a nice hiding spot. Just look around and be creative.Bottom line? The Plaza gives you a room for dirt cheap. The room is fine....contrary to what some others may say. Just remember....you are never in there but to sleep and shower and if you are having fun...you may never be there at all!! :)","2013-09-17T12:02:59","145185.0","-1","2013-09-17T09:44:36","ZD111316","New York","1974-01-01T00:00","10040","5.0"

'05. It was the first time that I went to San Fran. The reason I booked at this hotel was because of the price and location. I made a good choice. The rooms are little on the smaller side but you are not going to San Fran to stay in your room. The rooms were very nice. A lot of shopping restaurant bars and a mall nearby. The staff was very kind and friendly and this is the reason I'm booking at this hotel when I go to San Fran in september.

This hotel was rated a 3 star. I booked for 3 people and got a room with one small double bed and a pullout couch. The pullout couch was in such bad condition that you could not sleep with it pulled out. The couch folded up was not much better. After I booked i saw reviews online about this hotel which stated that the hotel was dirty and there a few comments about mice. I called up hotwire right away and the hotwire associate was unbelievably out of line. I told him about the reviews letting him know that perhaps the condition of the hotel was not the same as it was when hotwire first partnered with the hotel or gave it its star rating. When I mentioned the mouse he told me Look I have watched 20/20 and I know all about how everywhere has mice. How can it be acceptable to have a 3 star hotel with mice. This hotel would probably have been great 30-40 years ago in its art deco glory. But there has clearly not been any renovations or upgrades in at least 15 years. I cannot fault the hotel since with any quick search of the hotel your know what you are getting your self into the reviews don't lie. I can only fault hotwire.They claim that you will have a hotel with a specific rating and that it will be comparable to reputable named hotels. This did not live up to the hotwire description. Booking with hotwire leaves you helpless. You have NO power at the hotel to complain about the conditions since you have already paid. This hot is old do not expect frills. The carpets are weathered and worn the couches are uncomfortable the beds are hard. This hotel is also loud. First room was 2H this faces 1st AVE loud street noise. Then we were switched to 5AII this room had less street noise but the toilet would run constantly. I would say if you are looking to book a hotel do not book here I am sure you can find something better. the trip in from Jersey would be well worth it! But if you were like me and booked through Hotwire and did not choose this hotel but are stuck with it I saw just be prepared. I made my self sick after reading reviews hoping they were not true but fearing they probably were. My tips would be:Do NOT bring ANY food into the room so the mice won't stick around. Keep your luggage zipped up even if its on a table the mouse in our room was on teh table!Bring ear plugs.Ask to switch rooms some will be better than others. The restaurant is nice and they give out free breakfast vouchers to solve all problems so take advantage of that.Good luck and sorry if anyone else gets roped into this hotel by hotwire. I will say that the Beekman staff overall were nice and really this hotel is just bad so if you book there it is what it is so to some degree i Do not fault the beekman staff. The star rating should for sure be downgraded though.","2013-09-17T12:10:30","146834.0","-2","2013-09-17T11:14:44","ZD111445","Ohio","1991-01-01T00:00","45071","5.0"

Only downsides were two: 1) there's a lot of panhandling and down-and-outers in this neighborhood and 2) climate control was a bit difficult as the weather was hot and our room was top-floor facing west.

What other hotel in Vegas charges for parking? I think the $15 is a scam. If it really costs the hotel $15 for the services they claim to be providing add it to the daily room rate. The valet service is horrible. We returned for an afternoon of shopping at the outlets and could not even pull in to the hotel entrance there were so many empty cars sitting on the drive. When I was finally able to pull in I had to flag someone down to take my keys and give me a ticket. Going out Saturday night was worse. The cars were still backed up on the drive. It took 45 minutes for the valet to pull our car up and he had a nerve to look at me for a tip. The service and attitude of the people at this hotel is horrible. I will never stay again. Oh wait don't forget the train at 4 AM in the morning or the horrible pillows. Stay away.The one positive the bell captain was excellent. He went out of his way to answer questions and provide recommendations for places to go and eat in the areas we were going to be in around vegas.","2013-09-17T13:13:03","109251.0","5","2013-09-17T11:01:50","ZD111413","Oregon","2016-01-01T00:00","97385","5.0"

Just returned after 4 days at the Shelburne. Had been a little concerned after reading past reviews but was pleasantly surprised. The reception staff were friendly and gave us an upgrade to a two bedroom suite fantastic. The suite was huge with two double rooms each with two double beds two bathrooms and loads of living space.Yes it does need refreshing but compared to UK standards it was positively palatial and with a view of the Empire State Building thrown in. We were travelling with 2 teenagers and the facilities of internet access in the den and 3 tvs in the room kept moaning down to a minimum when not out exploring.Don't eat in the hotel though. Scotty's diner across the street by E39th is great and cheap Umi sushi on E31st is brilliant for a try of japanese cuisine. The waitresses are very friendly and helpful. Have the rolls if you aren't sure about raw fish. Go on a bus tour use the subway it's easy and cheap do the museums in the evenings when it's quieter. The concierge is really helpful and the door men will get you a taxi in seconds.

The hotel seemed OK from the website and reviews so I thought I'd give it a try for an overnight stay in Montreal. The front desk experience was OK although I was sure that the Travelocity reservation mentioned a complementary continental breakfast but the front desk person said that they didn't have one. The room itself was quite worn and my wife said that the carpet was dirty. The ice machine down the hall had its front hanging on by its hinges and the dispenser was held together by what looked like caulking (probably some sort of adhesive but it certainly wasn't done with care). The pool was OK and a decent size but shallow. When leaving in the morning they had the entrance to the front of the hotel blocked off to cars for some unknown reason so I had to circle around and re-enter through the pay parking lot (but I didn't have to pay; it was just a pain). If I had paid $120 I would have been very unhappy. At $84 I was OK. If I could have given it a 2.5 rating instead of 3 I would have. Would I recommend it to a friend though?

Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express at 45th and 5th.The hotel was great in every aspect. From check in to check out everything was smooth. When I addressed any need to the front desk it was handled right then--no waiting. From baggage storage need for toothpaste baggage retrieval and assistance with a cab--it was immediate!The rooms were very nice though small. The overall coziness though led us to stay in the room more than usual--we skipped getting show tix for Sunday PM in favor of watching TV. The variety of channels was excellent. The beds/linens are so comfy. The location is the best-subways close by.A good variety is offered at the complimentary breakfast. Also there is free internet service in the lower lobby. Ice machines on several floors.No room service but plenty of dining choices within a block.Also close to Rock Ctr. AND the Red Flame Diner is one street down on 44th. Can't wait to return.","2013-09-17T14:07:26","121991.0","0","2013-09-17T09:48:23","ZD111589","Texas","2000-01-01T00:00","78676","5.0"

About $300 per night for our room which was about as good as I could find in Manhattan that seemed like a nice place. The lobby had stained carpet and the apples in the bowl had rotten spots...not too attractive when you first walk in. Although it is an old building the room furnishings were nice. Nice linens. However the plumbing needs updated. Drain in tub didn't work and it took forever for them to send someone up to fix it but he didn't have the part so he substituted something else. Very low water pressure. They never did anything about it.Staff including manager was not friendly at all. Since the plumbing never got fixed the entire 3 days we were there they reluctanly took off one day of parking after I almost begged. They tried to charge us for an extra day of parking anyway so the manager was convinced he'd given us 2 free days. We tried explaining that we weren't there 3 full days yet he wanted to charge us for 4 days.Great location.

First the front desk (Melinda or Melissa) didn't bother to look up from the desk while she asked me for my license. Afterwards had the nerve to ask me if me and my brother needed seperate beds! No he is not my brother he is my husband She would have recoginzed this if she looked up from her computer for one second to take a look at us! She did not even apologize! What a [--]! She just chuckled and went on checking me in like nothing happenned! I was clearly annoyed and became more annoyed when I realized that I was paying $400 for a tiny box with Frette sheets and Fredrick Fekkai shampoo with a blow dryer that doesn't work. Worst of all I asked the front desk (another genius) directions to Little Italy she sent me to Brooklyn!!! By the way the N doesn't go to Grand Ave PLEASE TAKE NOTE!!!!

The room is somewhat outdated and small. That may be unavoidable considering manhattan's skyrocketing expenditure. The location is rather good. First of all it cost $24.10 from La Guardia airport by taxi and $26.10 to the airport by taxi. The fare is lower than the limousine bus which charges $15 per person and takes much longer time.Chinatown and Little Italy is just one or two block away and subway station(Canal St) is just one block away toward southway. You can go uptown and downtown by bus on Centre and Broadway St respecitively. Those two roads are just one block away right-side and left-side. You can go to a disco club(Santos Party House) by walking southway to the Walker St and just going straight across that street. Don't forget the address of the building. If you don't insist on staying at a luxury hotel nor at a hotel near the Rockefellow Building then stay here with comparatively lower price. But be careful not to be deceived by the Chinese bell man who showed aggressive attitude to me when he urged to take the hotel's sedan taxi for $35. To JFK airport it is $45 by yellow cab but to La Guardia it is just $26$2 for driver tip. You can save $7 by taking yellow cab.","2013-09-17T14:43:58","112838.0","2","2013-09-17T11:09:22","ZD111255","Washington","2000-01-01T00:00","98477","5.0"

Getting there: Good thing we printed out the name and address of the hotel in Chinese because Shanghai is enormous and the taxi driver would never be able to find this place without the address. Even with the address a few taxi drivers drove right past. We had to point out the ibis sign. But the hotel is like off the main road down a driveway. So it's not easy to find.2. Checking in: HAHA they don't speak English. The whole time we were there only one manager spoke and understood English well enough for us to have a coherant conversation. That said between hubby and I we do speak a little halting Mandarin and I could definitely say that it was still better than the staff's English.So the check-in was a bit slow. And they gave us a smoking room though we did request non-smoking when we made our reservation. Their response was that the hotel is new so the cigarette smell wouldn't be noticeable. WRONG!! But because it was so hard to communicate we just bared with it. But NEVER AGAIN.The bellboy showed us to our room. And *shock horro* it was occupied. So he left us in the corridor to find a new room.3. Amenities and facilities: Bathroom amenities were just the toothbrush unknown brand toothpaste and some soap and shampoo. Bring or buy your own stuff. Their stuff is probably like the cheapest you can find anywhere. They have free internet downstairs BUT haha I couldn't work out how to work the computer. The typing all came out as Chinese writing!!!Oh yeah the free broadband in the room for your computer was good. I think that's why I chose this hotel coz of the free internet. Others were charging ridiculous amounts for broadband.4. Restaurant: The breakfast was RMB20 per person which is super cheap but expect to get what you pay for. Being very unadventurous as far as food goes I didn't try most of the things there and there really wasn't very much there for you to choose from either. Porridge fruit salad some dumplings (that didn't taste nice) and oily salty fried noodles. Juice. I only ate there once. It was enough..5. Location. Ok location. There's a big shopping centre across the road. Carrefour. Many restaurants though I would say the restaurants are kind of expensive there. But to get to the attractions and into town it was a bit of a hassle. No train within walking distance we'd take a taxi to the nearest train station. The taxi was about RMB20. Not too expensive. Just a hassle.Taxi to town was about RMB40. Taxi back from town was RMB65. More expensive coz the taxi would have to make a huge round. Take the train to the science centre stop and take a taxi from the taxi stand there.6. The room: Small with lots of corners that you can stub your toes on. Didn't like the smoking room smell. But I suppose that's subjective right? Tiny little bathroom cubicle which I assume is standard with Ibis hotels. The shower leaked a lot of water into the bathroom and so the bathroom floor was freezing cold all night.Overall ok for the price. I paid RMB245 per night. Very cheap for a room in Shanghai. But next time I think I'll stay at Novotel Atlantis or Sofitel Hyland. I ate at both hotels and prefered the locations. Didn't like having to take taxi everywhere.","2013-09-17T12:27:51","117354.0","4","2013-09-17T10:59:37","ZD111284","Arizona","1975-01-01T00:00","86336","5.0"

I don't recommend anyone pay for it because if so you will save money on a hotel (and quality) but spend on the taxi which is ridiculous. 4.

Do not bother paying for a private bathroom unless you are extremely familiar with your travelling companion - the bathroom door is made of frosted glass and does not entirely shut there is a clear glass window into the bathroom and distance between the toilet and the bed is about 1 metre. I ended up using the toilet in the shared bathroom in the hall most of the time.2. Don't expect to get a good night's sleep without earplugs. The walls are paper-thin and the bathroom vents connect so you can hear people talking in the surrounding rooms and the hallway - even quiet conversations of an intimate nature.Having said that the hotel staff were friendly and professional the hotel is clean and the decor is stylish.The deal is supposed to be that the rooms are small and simple in exchange for more 'style' than you would otherwise receive at this price.However I wish they had spent more money on common sense design features (like proper walls and doors) and less on the glossy minimalist lobby and hallways.","2013-09-17T13:25:36","119174.0","4","2013-09-17T09:43:05","ZD111302","Florida","1969-01-01T00:00","32869","5.0"

Check-In was good2. Lost our luggage bringing it up to the room which delayed us over an hour.3. Rooms are above average although the lighting is very poor4. Grand Lux Cafe B&amp;B Restaurant and Dos Caminos in the Pallazio all delivered with great food.5. The casino was average; although not for the frugal gambler.6. The hotel is large trying to service a lot of guests so if you are driven by customer service basically don't go to Vegas and don't stay at the Venetian. It took 2 days for the maid to provide full-service to our room.7. Canyon Ranch Spa was lucsious and an experience to remember; although the pick-up service in the spa was poor8 The Venetian needs to seriously consider having an outside entrance/exit to Tao Beach and other pool scenes. The hotel was inundated with trashy obnoxious drunken scantily clad under-aged teenagers and young 20 somethings obviously there without adult supervision or any display of respect for themselves and those around them. This included guests and non-guest (identified with green armbands) alike. There was no apparent intervention by the hotel or security. I find this irresponsible of the hotel to allow this behavior to impact paying patrons. At least they could enforce a dress code throughout the inside of the hotel.....a bathing suit cover-up would be a start. 9. All in all the Venetian was a total dissapointment....see #8. Some things worth doing is to visit the Minus Five Degree Bar at the Mandalay Bay dine at MIx at the Mandalay Bay take a Sundance Helicopter Tour to the Grand Canyon as early as possible Roller coaster ride at NY NY Canyon Ranch Spa at the Venetian and take Limo rides vs. Taxi rides....it's worth the extra money.Stay at Palazzo vs. the Venetian...the issue stated in #8 seemed to be controlled there. If you are getting married or renewing your vows like we did then do not book your event at The Wedding Bells Chapel. Go to www.aboutvegasweddings.com and check out my review.My last parting words for the Venetian.....get some class and put your clothes back on!","2013-09-17T12:15:45","137829.0","1","2013-09-17T10:54:52","ZD111122","Illinois","1990-01-01T00:00","60301","5.0"

Reserved a Nonsmoking room and confirmed on check in that did indeed want non-smoking as I have difficulty breathing around smoke due to asthma. Given key for nonsmoking room only to exit the elevator to have to hold breath as was very smokey in hall. In the room was an ashtray and matches. Upon calling the front desk was informed that they did not have any truly non-smoking rooms so we were given a smoking optional room as they usually don't smoke in there anyway. (Was able to downgrade to a smaller room that was on an entirely nonsmoking the next day.)2. Someone used a key to open the door without authorization or reason (when latched) during the night while we were in our room resting. The Hotel said they have no way of tracking who entered the room. (The latch over the door prevented it from opening fully.)3. To access the AMAZING DELICIOUS restaurants you must walk through very smokey casinos and have no way of getting there without going through smoke which caused me to have an asthma attack trying to leave the Buffet. 4. Little to no soundproofing/insulation between rooms as could hear EVERYTHING (including basic conversations from those in nearby rooms as well as other sounds).5. The downgrade room (grateful yes that it was nonsmoking) had the shower smaller -- lower ceiling and shower head causing someone 5'8 to have to duck. I'm surprised they are not made to at least accommodate someone 6'0.6. Overall HIGHLY recommend the resaurants as they are some of the best foods I have ever eaten. If you smoke or enjoy being around it you would love this hotel. I simply was unable to fully enjoy it as prefer breathing.","2013-09-17T12:45:07","125070.0","-2","2013-09-17T11:50:21","ZD111527","Illinois","1950-01-01T00:00","61110","5.0"

The bed is way way too soft - as are the pillows. If Holiday Inn can give pillow choice why can't Trump?3. Booked on Hotels.com ... the price didn't include the $15 resort fee which is mandatory. Unlike other 5-star type resorts this didn't include the internet which is another $12per day.4. Valet is extremely slow despite being quiet. When I complained that it had taken 20 mins instead of simply stating he was sorry for the inconvenience the valet embarressed himself by calling the valet supervisor and confirming that it hadn't taken 20 mins it had in fact taken 16 !!!5. For two days I called for the room to be serviced on leaving at 11am. Returning at 4pm to find it hadn't been done.6. They have kitchenettes. In mine there were no knives no kitchen roll (which you get at the much better MGM Signature) and the stove top didn't work.7. They have a desk but no desk chair so anyone wanting to work on their laptop will have a bad time.8. The coffee machine which was also a bit broken down got refilled with ONLY de-caf - twice.Frankly for a 5-star hotel this is rubbish. I usually stay in identical sizze suites at the MGM Signature which you can often get cheaper. This hotel looks like they ran out of money.

Extremely safe and touristy area. Rooms are motel size VERY clean have probably the biggest showers I've ever seen at a motel. Front desk are quite helpful. We did skip breakfast as it was a joke but used their wireless connection which worked great. Parking is 10$ per day and it's a great deal too. The only downside consisted in the house keeping lady who lets her little daughter play in the guest rooms while cleaning. Not really professional. She left our tv on for all day on a cartoon channel. I would definetely stay there again as it is the only option if you do not want to spend 170$ at the hotels nearby nor want to end up in a proprer hotel just in the middle of the Tenderloin. We paid 89$ including taxes and parking (weekday) which goes up to 139$ including taxes and parking during weekends. checkout their website they have special internet rates.

They did answer the phones very quickly but they were always very curt. They are very aware of the issues with the hotel but refuse to fix them. see below.2. We were upgraded to a suite because we could not exit our room It turns out that all of their doors are wooden and swell which makes it impossible to exit during an emergency. they had to take off the door. 3. The executive suite is NO executive suite. POOR drainage in tub. very old out-dated kitchen and utensils the t.v. remote did not work. the buttons on out-dated tv were missing. only one very small trash can in the room. They also give you a key with your room number stamped pn it and a card attached advertising the hotel. Montreal is safe but that is crazy. Hotels stopped doing that more than a decade ago. the elevators are very small and slow. 4. The business center is NOT a business center like everything else the computers are outdated (1990) slow and the printer was out of ink. they only ALLOW you to use it for 30 minutes then they charge you. it takes 30 minutes to get on the computer. we had a laptop but needed to print boarding passes. They charge 4.95 per day for wi-fi in the room. 5. Excellent location close to subway and Saint Catherine street. 6.

Hotel staff is helpful and friendly &amp; every willing to help. 4. Location - A little hard to find but you can get here for RMB 16 (16Yuans) from the airport by bus. I would recommend printing the address in Chinese. The bus from the Beijing airport drops you off at the Beijing Train Station and the hotel is a short walk from there. Really easy to get around Beijing from here using either the local bus (tickets are 1 yuan) or by the Beijing subway (tickets are 2 Yuans.) Taxis are also very cheap.5. Things to look out for -- tours made at the hotel are subjective. I did not have a good experience booking a tour through the travel desk at the hotel. They use a company called Beijing Youth Travel Service. Our guide hardly spoke any English and it was a mixed group of Chinese &amp; English tourists - she primarily interacted with the CHinese tourist which is fine expect I thought I was on an English tour.6. I would highly recomment The QinChunJiaRi International Travel Service. I found them while walking around Tiananmen Sq. Our guide Leena was great witty articulate - in short she knew her stuff. If you have time I would recommend booking tours last minute through this company while you are strolling around Tiananmen Sq. on your first day in Beijing.","2013-09-17T15:15:09","114616.0","-5","2013-09-17T12:16:56","ZD111545","New Hampshire","1997-01-01T00:00","3303","5.0"

By the time I made it back to the room I was not able to leave the toilet (not a drinker btw). By the next morning my wife was woried and threatened to cal EMS. She agreed to look elsewhere and found In Room Doctor. Dr. arrived and advised we most likely got it from the room(s). I say we because yes the wife got it as well. $2000.00 later we were able to leave the room for the airport. Good thing I had hit a couple of jack pots prior to near death experience.

There is no satellite TV so we only had chinese channels. The bed was really hard though.4) Service: I would have had little complaints about this hotel if not for the service. We'd asked for a late check-out (for 2 pm) the night before and the next morning the reception called to ask abt our check-out. We told the lady that we arranged with her colleague the night before tht we were checking out late and then she told us to make sure we were out of the room before 2pm. We turned up at the reception counter 15 mins late.

The breakfast selection (included) was excellent. We got the tube to Vauxhall and walked past MI6 to hotel.(10 mins). Next day we walked to Westminster Eye etc. (10 mins in opposite direction). 4 of our party were upgraded as thier rooms were not ready when they arrived (there was no hesitation from the staff )and they had the use of the executive lounge which they thoroughly enjoyed. For a short stay I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.

I have rented several hotels along the WA and OR coast with a mini kitchen - and ALL have a few dishes a few pieces of silverware hand can openers (dish cloths and dish towels) and a microwave oven. 7. Movie selection - is not current. TV programs: NBC Fox ABC (Alexis Resort Personal Billing channel - that never had an accurate billing posted for my room Station/Computer program - non functional)ESPN ESPN 2 ESPN News CNN Headline News Cartoon Network Weather Channel Las Vegas channel - non functional TBS. NO PREMIUM CHANNELS.8) No Shuttle service to the strip or to the airport. From Alexis Park to the strip - is a very hazardous section of roadway. Cars and taxis are going from 45- 60 mph and make quick entrances into and out of properties along Harmon Ave. There is a sidewalk. Staff will tell you that the Hard Rock Hotel - across the street has a shuttle (to Las Vegas Ave) every hour on the hour. The Hard Rock shuttle does not charge for the service. 9) Alexis Park room amenities: Iron/ironing board 5 hangers queen bed (springs were terribly noisy) 3 drawer chest of drawers 2 nightstands couch/bed chair 2 bar stools small mini kitchen with single serve coffee maker and 2 coffee packets/2 condiment packets. Several towels were dingy and some had terrible stains stains on the sheets as well. Laundry staff may not be using bleach for the laundry. No care is taken to provide clean looking towels and sheets.10) There was plenty of hot water for 2 nice long showers daily - and the hotel room was clean. My room had 4 sprinklers - and a working smoke alarm.11) Room keys stop working after 7 days. At the end of 7 days the room key did not work. Staff did not alert guest to this standard issue at time of entry to hotel. Nor did staff member apologize for the inconvenience to guest. Front desk staff not courteous to guests - a lack of common courtesy appeared to be standardThe stay at the Alexis was for business. It is known that several business associates stayed one night - and found better/less expensive housing in Las Vegas.

On 8th May 2008 I went down to get breakfast (around 7:45 am) and saw my car parked in the lobby. I was concerned since I had not called my car; the Valet brings the car to the front entrance at the request of the client. When I spoke to the concierge they brushed me saying it must be a mistake.

The rooms actually cost $235. There are no $180 rooms. So they know how to fool a search engine. Use caution.2) The rooms are literally 3 feet larger than the king bed inside it. Just enough room to walk around the bad. There are no dressers. There is a writing desk in the room but you can't sit at it. No room for the chair sitting oddly next to it. There is no closet. The bathroom is about 12-inches larger than the toilet. Luckily I wear only a size ten shoe otherwise... The water pressure is bad - not enough to enjoy a shower forget about filling the tub.3) The restaurant is embarrisingly bad. Especially for the big city. We waited a half-hour for coffee and another 60 minutes for breakfast only to finally get hard cooked eggs and rare bacon. We were told that the cook didn't show up. While we were comped breakfast the family next to us shared this experience but were not comped and a twelve dollar gratuity was added to their bill. There is no manager on premises on Saturday morning and the assistants in charge of the front desk didn't speak English very well so there is no chance to communicate the subtlety of things. Requests for clean glasses for example could npt be communicated.4) Now I am a native NY'er so when I tell you this you should take it seriously - this is a HORRIBLE location for a family to stay. On Canal Street bordering Chinatown simply disgusting. You should never let your wife or kids out in this neighborhood alone. In fact our first night here three people were murdered within walking distance of this dive and two were auxilliary policeman. So don't select this place because of it's supposed convenient walking distance to SOHO and the Village.If you like apologies offers of discounts on inedible food and argumentative managers this Holiday Inn may be what you are looking for.","2013-09-17T13:09:16","142235.0","4","2013-09-17T09:50:52","ZD111517","Georgia","2012-01-01T00:00","30999","5.0"

Got in late mid-August and my daughter and I were about to climb into bed around midnight when we pulled the duvet back and discovered pubic hair on the sheet. They sent someone up with new sheets except the sheets were too small and he was the night accountant who worked there two nights a week. He didn't know how to make a bed. I also had to ask for a new duvet cover which he initially didn't bring. My daughter and i ended up having to make the bed with him and had to put two sheets end to end to cover the bed.2) Ineptitude with attitude especially among the staff of the front desk. 3) The concierge gave me the wrong schedule for the Tower of London tours when he sold me the tickets. He said they let people in up till five but that those inside could stay until 6. My daughter and I got there at 4:15 to discover that the doors close (meaning everybody out) at 5. 4)Don't keep their wordl Since we were arriving late Saturday evening Iwas concerned we would get the dregs--the dark room looking at a brick wall. So I called the headquarters a month in advance to make sure that didn't happen. I was told I should call early on the day of arrival so that a good room could be allocated to me. I did and spoke to the front desk manager. When we got there we got the small dark room with no headboard a desk that almost blocked the way to the bathroom and a bathroom with no hooks to hang the towels. And yes the made bed with the pubic hair.My friends' no smoking room had a cigarette butt in the toilet.5) Lack of paperwork. They transferred me and the rest of my party (we had three rooms altogether) the next day---and the rooms were fine. One room was even an upgrade. The staff had put our bags in the different rooms and we were handed the key cards. But the folder the key cards were in didn't have our names. In fact they had other people's names that were stricken out. When my friends checked out a day ahead of me they found out that they were checked into my room and vice-versa. but we had no way of knowing we were in the wrong rooms because there was no paperwork. They were assured it didn't matter that the wrong names were on the receipt but when I came down later in the day to check on my airport car reservation I found out that my reservation had been canceled because the people in my room had checked out. I was not in the system at all. 6) Service no. Laziness yes. It took me about 20 excruciating minutes to get the whole mess cleared up. I had to repeatedly give them my name and they repeatedly told me I had checked out. The front desk manager---the same one who assigned the lousy rooms in the first place--had known about the mix up but apparently didn't think it was necessary to correct it on the records or to inform me about it.7) HOT AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY. the air conditioner in our room was weak. It took them two days to figure our they couldn't do anything to fix the motor. On our last night they sent up a small desk fan.8) ONLY ONE staffer a concierge cum bell hop seemed at all interested in providing service. When my daughter and I said so after he brought our bags to the airport limo the driver of the limo wholeheartedly agreed saying he heard the same sentiments from other guests.9) DEFINITELY NOT A HOTEL OF QUALITY as they claim in a book left on the night table.","2013-09-17T13:25:33","141069.0","0","2013-09-17T09:52:14","ZD111514","Illinois","1972-01-01T00:00","60688","5.0"

This hotel is actually not bad for relatively inexpensive lodging. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated but i would recommend no more than 2 people per room. no dresser for storage but there was an open amoire type unit. Heavy clothes packers will not be happy with this arrangement. Bath was smallish but clean and with modern fixtures. Water was tepid with typically slow drains as with most older buildings. The hotel is situated on a relatively quiet (for London) tree-lined street close to the bayswaterpaddington and queensway tube stations. We were able to walk very easily to paddington to get on the heathrow express to the airport and to get the train to other destinations-very convenient. I am glad we picked this area because I thought other areas closer to city center were extremely busy and very noisy. Regarding the window situation---we were lucky enough to get a room with 2 windows one of which opened (room 101). It seemed that they may have resolved the windows as we noticed other windows were open also. I cant imagine booking a room without air in the warmer months however. I would have to bite the bullet and pay more for AC. Staff was very resonsive to any requests or problems. We booked thru expedia and were disappointed that our booking did not include breakfast.Paying for it is definitely not worth it. Go somewhere else if you have the time. We enjoyed our stay here but the heat issue in the summer would prevent me from booking here during that season.","2013-09-17T14:12:36","105469.0","3","2013-09-17T09:44:23","ZD111373","Illinois","1974-01-01T00:00","60609","5.0"

Because the place is off the strip its quieter. The casino downstairs is small by comparison but the betting is cheaper making it more fun (unless you're a high roller).They have a fitness center and guests can use the spa's steam room (NICE benefit) for free. I mention that b/c you get all the perks of spa amenities (robes slippers complimentary juices water tea coffeeetc.) for free...but massages cost extra.When you exit the hotel and turn right you hit the strip. When you turn left you hit some nice restaurants (McCormick and Schmick PF Changs etc.) If you go past the nice restaurants about 1- 1.5 miles you'll hit the real world places like Target and day-to-day shopping places to meet basic needs w/o spending an arm and a leg. Starbucks coffee in the room with a mini bar that you can empty out and use as a fridge while you're there. Daily USA Today papers delivered to your door. Wall Street Journal and LV paper available downstairs. If you want the WSJ though they're gone by 6am. Happy Hour from 5-8pm Mon-Thurs. Free beer wine and snacks with a big screen tv. During happy hour roulette is 25 cents craps is $3 and table games are $5. So get some cheap practice in before hitting the big places.I'd go back.

So you get a big dose of this cancer causing stuff. Didn't know before I booked reservations or I never would have stayed here.2) Hotel is plain too dark. Hard to even see where you're going. Either they are trying to hide something or save money on energy. Which is strange since they charge you an additional charge to use this electricity. You are not told until after you get there. So be aware that whatever you pay online you will be charged much more. They also charge you to park your car there overnight-$6.50 charge. I have never heard of a hotel doing this before.3) You are forced into a valet situation where you must tip them everytime. There is no self-parking.4) If you have children in your party this is not the right hotel for you. The halls are covered with paintings containing full frontal nudes and adult situations. One painting depicted a husband being caught with his mistress-who was wearing a corset and hands were tied behind her back. You do not want to answer questions about this sort of thing to a young child. It is art but it's not suitable for children.5) The room is the size of a shoe box.6) The matress is like sleeping on concrete. It was so bad I had to position all the pillows underneath me and sleep on top of them.7) Speaking of pillows this is so gross and I apologize for having to tell it to you but you must be told when I first walked up to the bed I noticed that one of the decorative pillows had what looked like -- on it.What angers me more than anything is the dishonesty. I believed that my stay would cost me one price then afterward find out they make up for it by charging you for other things. I just don't like that. Based on that alone I won't come back.Some good things: It is close to the strip.It was fairly clean.It's non-gaming and they do not allow smoking.","2013-09-17T14:13:34","150682.0","-4","2013-09-17T09:26:39","ZD111548","New Jersey","1972-01-01T00:00","7027","5.0"

There was a bit of confusion when we checked in at midnight when it appeared that one of our rooms had been accidentally cancelled but this was sorted out reasonably quickly. The rooms were quite big and the double rooms all appeared to have a double bed and single bed in each room which was surprising since we had heard that rooms in London were generally quite small. One of the rooms was a family room for 2 adults and 2 children on a separate floor and on the first night there was quite a lot of noise from football supporters that were staying on that floor. The next morning we complained about this and were moved straight away to a different floor and to a much larger room so no complaints there. The hotel was about two minutes walk from the nearest train station the bus stop was right around the corner and there were quite a few cafes and bars close by so the location was excellent. The hotel bar was also quite nice to sit in and grab a bite to eat. Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and would stay again. Only (small) complaint is that breakfast is a bit pricey it wasn't included in our rate of 89 pounds per room per night but since we were quite pleased with the price we didn't really mind that much and so we had breakfast at cafes close by instead.","2013-09-17T13:26:25","132105.0","-4","2013-09-17T13:00:07","ZD111526","New York","1970-01-01T00:00","11221","5.0"

He had arrived in London before us and was staying with friends near Warick University. The preceding night their baby was in hospital and so all arrangements changed. He left several messages at the hotel non of which were ever passed on to us.2) the next morning there was a bomb scare and sirens screamed through the hotel. Once we realised what was happening we walked down 11 flights of stairs to the rear of the building. Fortunately this was a false alarm but had there been a real bomb everyone on our floor would have died and if not because there was no follow up on the alarm but the route we took went right beside the bomb. we should have been directed to the stairs at the other end of the building. It was very scary wandering the empty stairwells not knowing where to go or what was happening.There should have been staff clearing the floors.3) the air conditioning never worked the whole time we were in London 4/5 nights. Hotel staff looked at it agreed it was broken and left. Very helpful!4) We had a key in the lighting unit which was stolen. This was reported to the hotel front desk but they said  that will be alright Chances are they didn't know what was reported as no one in the hotel spoke good english. Could this have resulted in 5?5) the highlight of our stay at this Novotel was my son's backpack was stolen from our LOCKED hotel room. These were very professional thieves as they had rifled through his suitcase without disturbing anything but stole one item from the bag that looked expensive but was a souvenir shot glass.They did hit paydirt with the backpack as it had all his electronic equipment a 16 year old travels with including laptop ipod DVD player etc. This was bad enough but the attitude of the staff was abysmal. First of all trying to explain what had happened to non english speaking management was a nightmare and then they Inferred that instead of us being the victims we were in fact making it all up. Trying to get insurance information from them to make a claim was very slow and with many obstacles in the way. We have only now received payment from the hotel insurers some 4 months later! and the looks from staff during the last day of our stay instead of being  those poor people have been robbed how can we help? was there go the theives!This incident was reported to the police and their comment was that hotel room theft in London is quite normal whereas the hotel response was  we have never had this happen here before. Who would you beleive?6) The area is close to St pancras and easy access for tubes and the chunnel but that does attract some strange people in the streets at night outside the hotel.Be careful of your wallet and those around you.","2013-09-17T15:15:26","116371.0","-4","2013-09-17T10:28:06","ZD111258","New York","1979-01-01T00:00","11499","5.0"

I found the weather great. The pool nice and the Jacuzzi hot. I have a lot of experience with other Extended Stays and have written reviews that are good about excellent people. However  I never met a worse staff as the Extended Stay in Las Vegas at this address. First of all the maid staff is lazy. I would go for laps in the day and they sit around smoking cigarettes outside the swimming pool gateway where us guests have to pass and enter. Second there's two days out of the week that they clean and they don't even show up. Third I tried to complain about the service on a day the maid was supposed to show up and the manager Carol Farmer excused the maid by saying  She showed up Sunday and serviced the room and she was not going to tell the maid to service my room that day. I was outraged. I tried to explain the maid did not come on Sunday when she was supposed to and my carpet was filthy. She denied my request to have my carpet vacuumed and dismissed my request making me feel like I was lying. How awful I felt. I had a dirty carpet. Mice run around the property on the sidewalks near peoples doorways. I also observed Carol not being able to handle her lazy staff. I asked for clean towels and without even looking a 19 year old girl at the front desk dismissed looking for clean towels and sheets by not even checking  and said  We ran out .I found the staff extremely lazy. Carol has no control over her staff and she doesn't have the proper skills to run a hotel. She's too easy on her smoking cigarettes staff when I needed something as easy as a quick vacuum . It would of took a maid 5 minuets but no while I complained I looked out my window and the maids were busy smoking cigarettes by the motel pool gate instead of doing what they were supposed too like vacuum for 5 minuets. I found that ridiculous. I was on the phone with her and I kid you not! 3 maids were smoking by those pool gates while she was denying me. I find her to be an awful manager. If carol farmer can't control her staff then can't a exec come in to investigate and see how lazy everyone is. If I wanted this kind of service I would of stayed at a low budget roach motel.","2013-09-17T14:45:03","145202.0","2","2013-09-17T09:08:38","ZD111206","Texas","1965-01-01T00:00","76087","5.0"

Thus location is not bad if you are active mostly on the Pudong side as cab fares for a few trips to Puxi side can easily make up for the low price of this hotel. 3) Room: the room is small and basic. There is no fridge no safe no hairdryer no iron and ironing board no tissue paper cups were provided instead of the usual glass cups and u have to bring ur own shower gel and shampoo. We did ask for a hairdryer from the reception but were informed for both days we were there that they have all been loaned out.

All members of staff were friendly and helpful.The rooms were huge we were on the 17th floor overlooking the strip (most of the view was the Luxor Hotel) I would recommend trying to get a floor above the 23rd Floor to get a better view of the strip. I absolutely loved the huge tub - when you sat in it the top of the bath was over your shoulders and also the his and her sinks and vanitys.Whenever we left our room and came back our room had been cleaned to perfection - I cant understand how people are complaining about the housekeeping service as ours was perfect. The bed was the most comfortable bed i've ever slept in (as a travel agent - I travel alot and have stayed in many hotels).Room Service was cheap enough and absolutely delicious and always arrived when we asked for it. all the public areas of the hotel and also the resort were spotless clean and flawless.If there was one thing bad I would say about the hotel it would be the location - it is quite a far walk to the middle of the strip but apart from that THEhotel was perfect. I will be recommending this hotel to all my clients family and friends. And when I get to go to Las Vegas again I will definitely be staying there again.","2013-09-17T12:59:20","138263.0","1","2013-09-17T11:19:36","ZD111400","California","1953-01-01T00:00","93614","5.0"

Here's probably why..............We (4 ladies from late 20's to mid 40's) traveled to London for a weekend. I trust Tripadvisor and I'm sorry to say this is the 1st time the reviews were way off (recently more accurate).1. Website said 6 mins from Liverpool st station.... Didn't state that was IN A TAXI !!! Told the taxi driver this and he burst out laughing and said it was much closer to 15 mins walking.2. On arrival we found both our twin rooms were doubles with a camp bed that was unsuitable for anyone over 10yrs. We were told this was 'an upgrade'. They failed to explain how swaping my single bed for a camp bed was an upgrade!!! I said this wasn't what I booked and would not take the room. I was shown two 'non smoking' rooms that smelt of smoke so badly we felt sick within a couple of minutes. The 4th room I was offered was fine. A non smoking twin - which as this was what we'd booked made me ask why we weren't given this in the 1st place!3. Sat morning we needed a taxi and called down to reception to book one for 10 mins later. We were told no problem. We went down to lobby and waited in full view of staff for a taxi that didn't appear. When we enquired where it was we were finally told the Consierge hails them and he wouldn't be around for another 10 mins. Now decidedly late we had to start walking and hail our own. This wasn't a problem but being told this on the initial call to reception would have been helpful! Just more poor service...4. The staff were less than friendly or helpful5. We went walking on the Sunday morning and felt unsafe. There were a number of people looking 'worse for wear' and it wasn't due to alcohol! Really not a great area. Taking into account the good price we paid and the room we finally got being clean and suitable I asked each of the girls would they use this Hotel again...... The answer was a unanimous NO.... NEVER AGAIN. Too far from the tube unsafe area and poor service.","2013-09-17T13:34:03","123091.0","1","2013-09-17T12:45:31","ZD111264","California","1995-01-01T00:00","94941","5.0"

I chose 196 Bishopsgate as I felt it meet our needs. I was by no means dissapointed. We checked in after 9 0 clock the receptionist was very polite and mannerly the reception was clean and there was a beautiful aroma in the area. Our room was on the third floor we didn't use the lifts we used the stairs instead every flight of stairs was immaculate and the smell of polish wafted in the air. The studio apartment was equally as clean and tidy there is everything that you could wish for in it. flat screen TV DVD player CD player trouser presshairdryer radio alarm clock. The kitchen was well equiped with all the usual aplicances. The bathroom is tiny but still fairly well equiped withh eated towel rail and plenty of towels. The apartment was cleaned on the Saturday and fresh towels were provided.

Restaurants:Tryed Olives and Rottisserie with buffets. Olives has a mediteran touch and Rottisserie offers food with arabian cousine. Joined the Beach Grill and Eau Zone with a very innovative menue. I can recommend all restaurants without restrictions. The Pool Bar was also very good with a wide range of drinks and snacks. Staff:Very friendly and competent staff. From the reception to the room service the staff in the restaurants and the bars they can not do enough for you. Location:Direct on Jumeirah Beach. The first hotel after the Palm Jumeirah. You can reach the Dubai Marina and the major shopping malls in a few minutes by taxi. Building work: yes disturbance: not at all. You can hear it only far away.I could write much more positive things about this hotel but to make it short: This was our 8th stay in the UAE. All in 5star hotels. All very good hotels (exept the Hilton Abu Dhabi - which is realy not good) but the Royal Mirage was by far the best hotel i have ever stayed.","2013-09-17T12:48:19","117086.0","5","2013-09-17T10:16:25","ZD111511","California","1960-01-01T00:00","92276","5.0"

I paid •À_55 per night and stayed for 2 nights.The room was clean bright and fresh and is near Moorgate tube which I believe has 3-4 tube lines which run from it. There is a Marks and Spencers down the road an ITSU restaurant on the corner as well as various pubs.The rooms were well decorated. All main corridors contained a vending machine which is handy if you have a hangover and need a quick drink. The lifts to the different floors are rapid.Staff were very helpful and we did have to bother them for a ironing board and iron on 2 occassions and they were lovely.I didn't really notice the noise outside in the day but in the nights I was half cut so can't really comment as would of slept through a tornado! We were over looking the main road which I think would be the best side to sleep as there is a nightclub at the rear. We didn't take up the bed and breakfast option but we did pay •À_7.50 each for breakfast on the Saturday morning. •À_7.50 does sound a lot of money if your not from London but to be honest without jumping on a tube there is nowhere really else to have breakfast. The breakfast was nice and it was all you can eat and drink which is handy with a hangover.I think this hotel would be better for singles couples or small families (1 child). The bar was open until 12.45am every night and is not really a bustling pub but as it say on the box a bar!Enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to anyone on a budget as the main thing you want is cleanliness and freshness!","2013-09-17T14:22:32","155531.0","5","2013-09-17T11:56:30","ZD111506","California","1951-01-01T00:00","95662","5.0"

People trafficing in and out all night doorbell ringing all night.. we could not understand the purpose for a doorbell in a part of a hotel where there was no staff at all. Very small untidy rooms. For example there was not space for one small person in the toilet if the door was closed.There was nothing in the room not even soap! Got a kettle after requesting it but no cups or coffee or anything. Wonder if you were expected to drink directly from the kettle.Another odd feature was there was a room without number. Still the door was going all the time! Interesting feature as well was that my room had a shover in the living room!

Flew out with Emirates - great half empty plane both ways could sleep across a row of four. will use them again defo.Check in efficient but a little cold. Taken to room (Sea View Deluxe) looked really nice. Was surprised no welcome pack in the room (fruit etc) as with most other five star hotels (have stayed at Jumeriah Beach Hotel previously) the only welcome were two WARM bottles of water! Which became a theme EVERY time you asked for water even in the restaurant - where are they storing this stuff because it isnt in a fridge!Housekeeping - very good. But you may need to bring a kettle if you prefer Tea as the Coffee maker in room dispenses luke warm water.Pools- good lifeguard attendance watch children near the large pool as it is 5ft deep and not very well signed.Restaurants - now where do I start. Blue Orange was open for our first three days. Floor was an accident waiting to happen. Breakfast was stone cold have never tasted a sausage so cold before and sometimes evening meals were strange combinations Moved the breakfast &amp; set buffet meals from then onwards. Breakfast in hunters need to train staff - tables half laid having to constantly ask for things. would ask if you wanted Tea or Coffee on seating then forget to provide. No butter- had to ask tea spoons missing. became a game in the end to see if we would get a fully set table. Evening buffet was served in the Ballroom (omg). some nights there were four/five groups sitting in the corridor outside waiting to be seated. Same problems again with service also noticed they didnt provide any typ of food for children? asked for two fosters waiter brought us two bottles - no glasses we had to send him back for glasses. by the end of our holiday I couldnt stand this anymore. restaurant service was a nightmare and the food became monotomous. the evening before departure you get a letter from service centre explaining that your checking out the next day and to please complete the customer questionaire (not enclosed) and they couldnt find one when requested. had to write everything on hotel paper. I will add here that they did call me once I got home to apologise and confirm that they had received my feedback but next time I will be staying at Mina A Salam. Westin needs to up its game because once all the new hotels are finished they are going to have to compete for the business at the moment they don't quite deliver. P.S watch your room bill carefully and keep checking it with reception took two days to resolve a charge which was for another room could you imagine what would have happened if we had left this to the last minute.","2013-09-17T13:42:56","116046.0","-2","2013-09-17T09:09:56","ZD111493","Georgia","1953-01-01T00:00","30345","5.0"

So for me and my friend it was just plain perfect.The hotel staff:The manager (a guy) was extremely kind to us. Explained a few things here and there and wished us a pleasant stay.The cleaners (two ladies) were kind aswel. Hmm so yeah basically that was the entire staff that I met due my stay there.My hotelroom:We stayed on the second floor in room number 315. There was no elevator so we had to carry our bags by stairs. Do-able I guess for young people with not that many bags but definitaly not visitor-friendly for old people with a bad back and many bags.My first thought of the room was; small warm decent.Then I looked deeper into it; TV - It snows a lot not many channels to watchBeds - comfertable but not clean. The sheets were actually dirty and my friend slept on a dirty pillowcase.Towels - You get towels but don't use them cause their dirty aswel. Just use it to dry your hands and feet with.Our view - the curtains were dirty. I had a lovely 'dead flies' print on it in other words; it was digusting to see. We didn't really had a view. Bathroom - It was terrible! It's small. But the thing that bugged me the most was no airconditioning (nor in the room itself). It was an extreme hot periode (17th till 24th july). You can shower as much as you want it won't work you will start sweating within few seconds. More must knows;- Your roomdoor is pretty heavy it will close by itself. You will basically hear a 'BANG!!!!!!!!!' when you don't close it carefully.There was a group of students that arrived closely to night.They were walking in and out their rooms so I was able to hear some doormusicbanging. It annoyed the hell out of me. The beds were also closely located to the hallway-wall so you can basically hear everything whats happening out there in the hall. - Your key is a card. You will need that card to enter the hotel and your room. Our card got defect once so we were stuck outside for atleast 30 mins until we were finally able to get the manager to come and open the door. So be sure to write down the hotel number just in case that happens to you.Breakfast:Breakfast was included but it was just a toast (with jam) cornflakes coffee/thee/orange juice/milk.The breakfast/bar/restaurant is located downstairs in the basement. It does look very lovely. I guess this hotel is ok. I really cannot say I had a terrible stay. It's good for people who has a low budget. I probably wouldn't go back booking this hotel. The rooms of the hotel do desperately need to be cleaned better and an entire facelift wouldn't hurt either.","2013-09-17T15:05:13","122311.0","-1","2013-09-17T11:54:51","ZD111562","Illinois","1995-01-01T00:00","60603","5.0"

The hotel was excellent from checking in to departure. Checking in was no problem even although there was 9 rooms to check in the staff were very friendly and always available to help. I stayed on the 31st floor and had nice views of the city - although I wasn't in the room for too long. The room was massive with a functional kitchen which meant I could make tea whenever I liked and my husband could have a cold beer from the fridge. There's a nice wee bar/diner next to the hotel where we all used to meet and a great breakfast place just round the corner - The Murray Hill Diner - the pancakes were amazing. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel I cannot fault any of the staff they were so nice and I would book this hotel again when in New York.","2013-09-17T13:25:21","128182.0","-1","2013-09-17T11:39:29","ZD111565","Illinois","2017-01-01T00:00","60101","5.0"

Its not the cheapest but what a nice place to stay and the area was very business like and not overly populated with tourists (us). Remember any room you book in manhattan will be small unless you are paying a fortune so don't expect huge rooms but again the time you spend in there is asleep anyway.

The rooms were beautifully decorated and had wonderful comforts such as a down duvet thick bath towels and plush bathrobes. There was even a TV in the bathroom vanity area!!! And the bed turn-down in the evening with chocolates was another pampering touch!! There was a complimentary continental breakfast off the lobby area with coffee biscottis and croissants. And there was complimentary coffee/expresso daily along with a daily paper delivered to your room. I could go on and on....It definitely meets the 4 star rating that it was given including the price.

I was rather disappointed that the swimming pool was nothing like they had displayed on the photo infact it was tiny and could have done with a good clean. There was no bar in this hotel and restaurant facilities only available in shopping centre. The staff attitude was a big issue. obviously when you have booked a hotel they know your check in and check out date. we booked through an agent as a package our flight back home was at 23:45 and we recieved a note from the hotel mid week regarding our transfer that evening the hotel informed us we would be picked up at 20:00. what they didn't inform us was that we had to check out by 12:00. we soon found this out when we arrived back to the hotel at 17:30 all ready for the airport our bags were in our room already packed since the morning we literally just had to pick them up. Our key would not work in the door so we went to reception to inform them. They then told us we should have already checked out and that we have to pay 50% of a nightly rate which was 360 dirhams (•À_55). We were willing to make our own way to the airport early so we just needed to get our cases that was all we still had to pay. when i went to the room every thing was made up ready for the next people so there was really no need to charge us as we didnt stop them doing what they needed to do ie; cleaning.

Just walking around the corner we were fed &amp; watered for a fraction of the cost.My final thought on this hotel is that for the price we paid when we got back from a night out there was no residents bar available to us &amp; room service (food only) was a ridiculous price.

Nice hotel chosen due to reviews on this webpage. Got corner rooms very nice better view the higher up you go. Very comfortable beds. Fridge and coffee machine available freeof charge upon request.As good a location of anywhere in New York. Subway two blocks away. Short walk to Rockefeller 5th avenue times square central station. Lots of restaurants a few minutes walk away.Deli next door a rip off one over the road on the corner excellent for breakfast drinks and cups of tea! There's also an excellent oriental style deli a short walk away on 3rd ave.One tip asked the concierge about a car to take us back to JFK (4 of us with big suitcases) he said it'd cost $109 plus toll and tip. Spoke to Bell captain he got us a Lincoln town car for $55 all in. I suppose they've all got their hobbles.If I went to New York again i'd probably stay somewhere else just due to the sheer number of options available but I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that asked.","2013-09-17T14:03:38","137319.0","2","2013-09-17T10:15:16","ZD111491","New York","2001-01-01T00:00","14061","5.0"

Tried for an upgrade and the $20 tip worked for a KING RED ROOM on the 30th floor. Very clean modern accommodations. Our friends were not lucky with an upgrade and had a traditional room on the 16th floor which was also very clean. Our room had a big flat screen they had a standard 27 both had about 12 channels (I don't go to Vegas to watch TV) our room also had a little iPod stereo alarm clock which was excellent....might buy one for my room! Bathroom very nice with separate shower. The room had no coffee maker or fridge and the coffee shop at the bottom of the elevators charged $6 for 2 large coffees. Mon Ami Gabi is a great restaurant overlooking the strip we ate breakfast there. If you and your travelling companion can agree on something to share the portions are HUGE and plenty big enough to split so french toast will cost you $5.50 each coffees again are $3 each. The pool is plenty big enough with lots of chairs on the weekend they had a DJ. The Paris location is very convenient on the strip 10 minutes to the IP Harrahs or Flamingo or 10 minutes the other way to MGM. It was a little bit of a walk from the parking garage to the check-in but once that was over getting from my room to the casino or the strip or the pool was quick and easy. Paris has a nice casino but no Poker room no problem since Planet Hollywood is really just next door. I would definitely recommend PARIS!","2013-09-17T13:02:23","156349.0","-4","2013-09-17T13:02:58","ZD111408","New York","1975-01-01T00:00","11369","5.0"

Do not fall for the 4-star rating as I did the Parc 55 is basically a Super 8 Motel that added some additional features to earn 4 stars (like putting an old phone in the bathroom). The room service was basically frozen food that was microwaved and they turn down the intensity of the a/c at about 10:30am each day to save themselves money but that means that if you're in the room after that you'll sweat a lot (as I did each day!). The hotel staff are not friendly (except for the house keepers) and when I complained I didn't even receive a call back. I complained again and asked for the manager to call me but nothing. The area is also not that safe at night as there were a lot of vagrants around starting at sundown. Oh and parking is $50 per day... yes $50 (with tax)!!! Across the street at a much nicer boutique hotel they were charging only $25 per day.You may think you are getting a good price by staying here but if you are truly used to 4 or 5 star hotels this will utterly disappoint. If you are used to 2 start hotels then this is the hotel for you.I was fooled by all the good reviews online at most travel sites but after looking at many of them it is obvious they are reviews posted by the hotel themselves just to pull people in. Don't be fooled by those pseudo-reviews... this hotel is awful and there are many (MANY!) better places to stay in SF. Don't suffer as we did... stay someplace else.I HIGHLY recommend you stay someplace else.","2013-09-17T11:39:15","116489.0","1","2013-09-17T10:37:11","ZD111130","North Carolina","1985-01-01T00:00","27569","5.0"

I booked my stay in this hotel via hotels.com and was given an average price of •À_174 per night. Pricey yes but a 4* in Canary Wharf must be good right? Well after pressing the confim button on the website i found that i'd been charged an extra •À_30 per night in hidden charges and there was a 100% cancelation fee. I needed a room for this week so dicided that although i should have cancelled the transaction via my credit card provider and found somewhere else it wasn't worth the effort. How wrong i was. Apon arrival at the hotel it was like stepping back to 1982 which is when i'd guess the last time this hotel was decorated. Flowery carpets badly varnished wood fake gold and brass everywhere. It's under a delusion that it's grand when in fact the only word that can describe it is Tacky. I booked a double but had to demand a different room when confronted with 3 single beds instead. Even the so called double i was moved to was 2 single beds pushed together. The hotel website offers wireless broadband throughout the hotel which is a lie as this only works in the lobby area and is slower than dial-up. The air conditioning throughout the hotel is awful and even after setting mine to its lowest temp and turning the fan up my room was never below 26. The Gym is advertised to open till 10 but closes at 9 everyday and again has air-conditioning problems so felt like running in a sauna. This seriously over priced for the lack of facitities and comfort.

Then there was a mixup about which apartment was to be ours. We went to breakfast after which I went to my office. When I returned we were settled in for a very decent four nights in a large two bedroom as booked on the third floor.We cooked in the apartment. The kitchen was adequately furnished. If I were anticipating the need for 'full fledged' cooking requirements the kitchen would be marginal. However we were making purchases at a Tesco Metro in the neighborhood and purposely trying to keep our meals simple to prepare (but we did eat well).We were there on the night of the smoke/fire alarm glitch (maybe they have these often?) but I went right back to sleep.A previous reviewer states that these apartments are to renovated in September 2006. I agree with the need for better windows for sound isolation. (In our subsequent journey to Scotland I saw at least three B&amp;B facilities that had upgraded windows to newdouble pane units. I guess the Scottish tourist board must be emphasizing this in its ratings.)This is a great area and (this being London) 130 Queensgate is a good value.","2013-09-17T12:08:14","116557.0","4","2013-09-17T10:37:27","ZD111329","South Carolina","1952-01-01T00:00","29626","5.0"

When I got to arrivals a man from the Chicago Beach was waiting for me and with profuse apologies explained that the hotel was overbooked and for the first night they had re-housed me in a different hotel - little did I know that I would be staying in the same hotel 16yrs later!The Rydges Plaza has had a few bad reviews on here - primarily it would seem due to either the furnishings or the location. I would like to challenge these reviews as I've just got back from a very pleasant 4 night stay here. It's not a theme park it's not a luxury enormodrome and it's not by the beach. It is VERY central and it's got some character.LOCATION:Right on Satwa Roundabout the hotel is minutes (depending on the traffic!) from the creek the airport Sheikh Zayed Road the beach anywhere. The taxis are cheap safe and regular. OK so there's a fire station opposite and a mosque over the road - but what do you expect it's a city centre hotel not a luxury beach hotel. The local area is full of decent cheap restaurants and there's a supermarket 3 mins walk away.ROOMS:The rooms are large well furnished spotless. The bed in our room was very comfortable and absolutely massive. The bathroom was large with a huge walk-in shower and plenty of smellies etc. TV was good - plenty of channels (BBC/Star etc).EATING/DRINKING:Breakfast was great - tasty and fresh staff very attentive.There are about 6 eating establishments in the hotel - didn't use them at all other than for a sandwich by the pool for lunch - which was fine. There's a Chinese a decent Indian Mexican American and Aussie Bar. The bar Aussie Legends was packed on the Thursday - decent enough prices for a beer too.FACILITIESA small but perfectly adequate pool area - not really a hotel for sunbathing. Large gym/health club. Business Area. Internet access etc.Overall an excellent hotel spotlessly clean staff who went out of their way to ensure that we were well looked after. Maybe I don't expect the world when I check into a hotel but I know what I want &amp; I know what I like - and this one ticked all the right boxes.","2013-09-17T14:33:18","136462.0","-5","2013-09-17T09:50:48","ZD111435","South Dakota","2006-01-01T00:00","57013","5.0"

The rooms were above average size with 2 double beds and they were spotlessly clean. The bathroom was a good size and it does have enough towels as well as soap shampoo and conditioner. You get irons and hairdryers from Reception. There are no safety deposit boxes but they will hold your passport at the front desk if you're worried about carrying it around. The staff were very friendly and were great about giving directions etc. around the city. The Hotel is half a block from Times Square and is in a great location. There is no bar or restaurant in the hotel but there are 2 deli's next door which are great for breakfast and snacks throughout the day there are also 3 Irish bars on the block which open til 4am and serve food all day. The heating in the Hotel is a bit loud and there are only blinds on the windows not curtains but that was the only thing I wasn't happy with.

We are very easy-going not snobs at all. Live in Westchester and decided that rather than spend the weekend flying somewhere exotic we would enjoy NY as tourists do nice hotel good restaurants broadway play. Shoreham offers the Spa package but before booking I call and ask specifically if we can book the package but in a king superior room but still get the spa package deal with champagne chocolates some body scrubs or whatnot and spa treatment. 1st thing they book us in the junior suite. nOT a king bed. Very uncomfortable for us we are not obese but not petite and the point is I specifically requested the king. When I called the front desk I was robotically politely informed that there were no other rooms available and that I didn't want them anyway. No view. Shower ran water ALL over the floor (they should add a lip on the door to prevent this - should cost them all of 25 bucks.) Shower was awesome though (many heads in this suite) although I would have given them all up and the jacuzzi (I told them this when I called to book it in the first place) for the KING SIZED BED.) Free breakfast is continental not the hot menu. Bar is nice and bar staff was nice in the evening snooty in the morning. Didn't get the chocolates or the bath spa stuff. the spa treatments were across the street at a nice little place and very nice. SPoke to concierge? Hideki 4-5 times first time when we were checking out who promised me they would make all the above right by me including the missing package items. He promised some female manager whose name escapes me would call. No call. I called many times. no call from the mystery woman. Also WAS OVERCHARGED for the shoreham's valet parking at the lot next door. they charged me 145 and i was told 45/day. We were there for 1 1/2 days. Figure 75 tops right? Recieved a tiny box of Lindt truffles and 45$ back for the parking and never heard from them again. If they respond to this review just know that they are just a mill hoping most people won't complain but AvOID THE SPECIAL PACKAGE. IT'S JUST A ROOM IN NEW YORK CITY. Next year we are spending only a little more and going to spend the weekend at the Ritz Carlton Battery Park which is LOVELY and similarly priced. Oh well 11th anniversaries are just as special right????","2013-09-17T15:19:50","158484.0","-2","2013-09-17T10:42:58","ZD111126","Texas","2013-01-01T00:00","77237","5.0"

The bed was very comfortable and the size of the rooms excellent.The bedroom was completely separate from the rest of the rooms.

The Subway to all lines are within a 5 minute walk.The Hotel does not have a restaurant but you have a huge selection closeby.The cab fare from JFK to the hotel was $45 USD.

We would normally of asked to change rooms however we were far too tired and fortunately we had ear plugs with us.All in all just ok plus points being a nice big comfy bed and the hotel does have a free limo which will take you to the Strip and the airport however it is not very frequent but a nice extra.","2013-09-17T12:23","141848.0","-1","2013-09-17T11:05","ZD111258","Alabama","1963-01-01T00:00","36617","5.0"

This same shopping centre also has a Disney shop.The bus stop is actually about 100 metres from the front door of the hotel whereas to actually get to the tube platform it's about 400 metres. From this bus stop you can go directly to Harrods Knightsbridge Picadilly circus and Waterloo. We used this off-peak and I reckon it was quicker then using the tube. You also got to see lots of parts of London you might otherwise miss. Finally cheaper then the tube.Close to BBC television centre - check out my review of same at http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d257586-r8408152-BBC_Television_Centre-London_England.html","2013-09-17T13:37:09","118324.0","3","2013-09-17T09:36:57","ZD111553","Arkansas","2002-01-01T00:00","72080","5.0"

We'd all been to the city before so the location didn't bother us. We used the hotel as a way of breaking up a very long trip. We headed off to LGA the next day so the location of this hotel was very convenient in that respect. Pros: we were both upgraded upon arrival!!! Rooms were fantastic. Extremely large massive windows comfy bed in a separate bedroom. Tv in the bedroom and sitting area. Gorgeous views from the rooftop bar. Have stayed at this hotel in the summer time and found the rooftop bar to have a fantastic atmosphere. The views from here are fantastic - especially at night. Depending on the purpose of your visit I think the location of this hotel has advantages. It's quieter and a bit more residential. Cons: bathroom amenities slightly lackingno tea/coffee in the room (had to go to the main lobby for it). The rooftop barwhich was nearly empty when we were thereclosed very early at midnight. I didn't notice a refrigerator or mini bar in the room. Breakfast wasn't included in our rate and we found paying $28 for 2 continental breakfasts (basically tea and bagels) to be a bit over the top.","2013-09-17T11:54:13","123911.0","4","2013-09-17T10:13:15","ZD111523","Florida","2003-01-01T00:00","33110","5.0"

It is until she was off and I spoke to the night time staff that they are able to change my room to Room 1004 which turned out to be a perfectly fine room without any pipes problems.Somehow the day time staff are nightmares but the night time ones are completely the opposite.

Walking distance to Little Venice and a little longer walk to Portabello Rd. and Notting Hill.

I know my rating is a little low but there were a few things that frustrated me with the hotel and as a result I lowered my rating.The rooms were clean the staff was very friendly and the decor is nice. But they try so hard to be funky hip and cool that they lose the ability to be practical.Some examples for you. They place the face cloths in the sink area and the hand towels in the shower area. Then once I fetch a hand towel I have no place to hang it up in the sink area. It ends up lying on the counter beside the sink.The closet to hang up your clothes consists of a 10 inch bar at a 45 degree angle and little knobs down the bar to catch the hangars. It looks nice and takes up very little room but try using it! It's impossible to manage the cloths on this bar.And finally you're going to shake your head at me for this but you know how all hotels give you a pad of paper and a pen to write with? Well here they still give you the paper but instead of a pen they give you a pencil. Yah a pencil. Try writting a postcard with a pencil and then mailing it.All these things are meant to be inline with the brand but I didn't care for it. Plus there was a problem with the bill (1 night stay with no incidentals and they make a mistake). It was taken care of but it was just another frustration I had to deal with 5 minutes before the shuttle leaves.Oh and that's another thing. The shuttle. If you stay here DO NOT stand at the hotel shuttle post outside the airport. They don't stop here (after 20 minutes of waiting I figured it out). They stop at post #2 called Parking and Via Rail and arrive about every 15 minutes or so. There is a free phone beside the baggage claim to the hotel.There is coffee in your room but only enough to make 1 cup of regular coffee or one cup of decaf. You may have to share.And one last thing do your research for food. Their selection is very limited and quite expensive. We ended up eating at the airport on arrival and departure days.Sorry so negative here when the other posts are so possitive. I guess this is a great hotel for some people but I was just frustrated by it. Although at $105 it was the cheapest one around.","2013-09-17T14:33:58","118652.0","-2","2013-09-17T10:21:09","ZD111168","Illinois","1985-01-01T00:00","60475","5.0"

Our room - VERY small. 2 Double beds in a very small room. Not enough towels even though they knew there would be 4 of us. I went to the front desk to see if we could get a larger room. Even though we were only staying for 2 nights it was going to get even smaller so I asked for a suite or a larger room - money was not an issue - just space. We moved to a larger room - Not a larger room at all just one that had a balcony-about 2 feet wide - WOW you couldn't put a chair if you wanted to and the street below and a view of the Ramada windows next door. The suites were being cleaned - I said we would wait - they put us in the room anyways and said they would call - they never did. Parking I was told would be $43 for the 2 day stay - No it was $43 a day and they forgot to tell you there is a $6 a day parking tax so it really cost $49 a day. Trust me I know how expensive parking in SF is but had I only been told it would have made it easier to take. Newly remodeled - maybe they should have left the maze out - very hard to get around/find your room/elevators/etc. The decor needed help that's all I can say about that. The room doors didn't even fit the frames - could see at night 1/4 of light all the way around the door frame. The really cool outdoor fire pits were really neat except most were either broken or out of gas - it was really cold when we went never got above 65 with rain and with all the smokers using them as an ashtray it was really gross. The one really good point was the staff was great and the location to Pier 39/Tours/Museums/Restaurants/Muni. This made it all better - almost. The time we had with family - priceless the cost of the room a night - more than $275.00 - not priceless.","2013-09-17T15:03:04","119280.0","-4","2013-09-17T09:55:30","ZD111111","Illinois","1974-01-01T00:00","60624","5.0"

Any way hotel is as almost everyone else has stated exceptional with the quality of the food being truly excellent (the guacamole at Maya being the culinary trip highlight) but in my role as truth teller there are just a few things to be aware of at 'Le Royal'. If like us you book into the tower be sure to ask for a room facing towards the Burj the views on the other side are not great and if i'm being honest a bit depressing.We were booked into a room facing the wrong way but the hotel kindly moved us after only 1 night and we instantly felt much happier. The staff and facilities are superb with no complaints whatsoever people who complain that standards are slipping and use the example that in days gone by the staff used to show them to their sunbeds and lay out their towels and now they do not are obviously never going to be happy perhaps next time it'll be.... 'the staff used to help me tear off my toilet paper and now they do not!'. If you are planning a trip to Dubai believe the hype this is a great hotel in a great location. One thing to bear in mind though a lot of the guests in the hotel are Russian and can be a little noisy at times. If you thought Americans and Germans were loud then you aint heard nothing yet! Also if you are offended by seeing petiteblonde trophy wives/girlfriends with large fat balding Russian men in speedos then stay clear...or do like we did and enjoy trying to spot the biggest bloke with the smallest woman there is plenty of competition. Finally if you're going to Dubai to propose or on honeymoon i can seriously reccomend 'Thai Pai' restaurant at the madinat Jumeria although like most places its on the pricey side the setting outdoors is great and the food is fab and if you organise it correctly and pre book (make sure to get a confimation number) you can get to the restaurant by a tiny littel boat (free with the confirmation number) that takes you through the canals right to the front door. I popped the question at 'Pai Thai' and my gorgeous girlfriend said yes so maybe i'm just a little bit biased.","2013-09-17T15:07:30","139624.0","2","2013-09-17T12:04:52","ZD111372","Indiana","1982-01-01T00:00","46103","5.0"

Our check in went smoothly even though I requested a room with 2 double beds we ended up being upgraded to the panoramic view king suite with a roll away bed. (As per my friend-the rollaway bed wasn't bad at all!!!- She actually got the best view being right beside the floor to ceiling window) The decor was super trendy and beds were super comfy. Trendy Bathrooms were equipped with shower full size tub and separate toilet with door including a flat screen tv. I judge a room by it's bathroom since a lot of trendy bathrooms can seem unclean and muggy. And Encore was exceptionally CleanWe did have two minor incidences which included calling front desk for a blanket but never received it. We didn't end up needing it but still it would have been nice to have received it. We also encountered a very rude front desk personnel that seemed to be bothered with our questions of wanting to checkout an hour later (which you have to check back at 9:30 AM the day of checkout- we didn't end up needing since checkout is at noon and where to print out our boarding passes (which btw you can ask conceirge but make sure you bring your confirmation code). It probably didn't help that some lady cut us in line while we had already waited 10 minutes for the rude lady behind the counter. The pools and amenities were super nice and new. Really liked the europeon style pool but was always crowded. No matter early or late. I would suggest that they make it a rule that people can't save their seats all day by leaving their towels on the chairs. It's really inconsiderate since most people only layout for at most an hour or so. We also enjoyed the nightclub XS which is a loungey club poolside with partial indoor. The set up is open and free flowing but would have liked a few more men staff. As we women were ignored by girl bartenders all night. We also had pre-drinks at Society which we were personally invited by a Blush club promoter by the pool. Overall We all really enjoyed staying at the Encore. (which has a separate entrance from Wynn)","2013-09-17T12:09:38","137773.0","-1","2013-09-17T10:24:45","ZD111114","Kentucky","2014-01-01T00:00","40051","5.0"

Loved the location in the UWS - felt very safe and the proximity to the museums was great. It was a simple walk to the Musuem of Natural History (even in 90 degree heat pushing a stroller) and a very easy bus ride to the Met Art Museum. The subway is only a 4 minute walk and we took that to the Empire State Building and to Chinatown. Air conditioning was perfect after walking in the hot city streets. We could not afford a suite anywhere so I was concerned on whether we would be able to fit the Graco play pen in the room with the 2 double beds. We were able to push one of the beds closer to the night stand and then were able to wedge the playpen inbetween the wall &amp; the bed. That left us with room inbetween and in front of the 2 doubles for walking. Squishy but fine. Bathroom was very clean. We were in room 1021 and we did not hear any noise at all - another big concern with our sleeping baby. Our room did have a window looking out but we did notice there were rooms in the center of the building - which I imagine did not have any windows or at least not one with a view. We also requested and received a mini-fridge at no extra charge.We would definitely stay here again.","2013-09-17T11:44:38","128869.0","-4","2013-09-17T12:37:09","ZD111429","Mississippi","2010-01-01T00:00","38632","5.0"

Other hotels we stayed at on this vacation did have working wireless connections so if you are desiring hi-speed connection I don't recommend this hotel.

The room was delightful very cosy very tiny but adorably cute and livable and charming with fine materials marble wood good quality cloth furnishings very well decorated a writing desk. The staff is helpful and polite. The manager was competent and friendly. I am bringing my family back to enjoy this hotel. I loved that my room looked out over a London street because it is a view I do not get in San Diego. A park while nice is not as interesting to me. There was no noise problem because of double paned windows and climate control in the room. The food is very good. The sitting area off the reception is inviting relaxed and it made me feel English. And they sent me a lovely bottle of wine for a foul-up. I wish I had taken a photo of the bathroom the room was small but the bathroom was roomy with marble and granite. The BadI booked this hotel via LastMinute.com and paid for it in full 3 weeks in advance. I had an early train that day from the North and arrived in London at 7:30 am. So I went to the hotel to drop off my luggage. When I arrived I was told very politely that they did not have a room for me for that night. I had to call LastMinute who an hour later solved the problem but I did not get the double room I had paid for but I did receive a refund for the difference. And I was fine with the room I did get. However initially they were going to ship me to another hotel until I stood my ground.","2013-09-17T11:44:34","133142.0","4","2013-09-17T11:17:37","ZD111443","New York","2005-01-01T00:00","10474","5.0"

Would recommend The Fitzpatrick Grand Central to all great location etc took time to fill out one of the Hotels questionaires and were surprised to recieve a reply 2 weeks after our stay just proves they must read them!

The whole hotel is encapsulated in scafolding and plastic therefore the views are lets say restricted (Do they inform customers of this fact before they book??)2. No Aircon. 1 very noisy clicking fan overhead. So nighttime choices are a) Can I sleep with this noise if I leave it on or b) Can I sleep with the heat and humidity if I turn it off3. Flush the toilet - cistern lid pops up (nice touch)4. Cold water tap. Leave this running for 5 minutes to let the boiling water run off. It eventually reduces in temperature to merely hot. (and no the taps weren't plumbed up wrongly)5. Breakfast - colleague order sausages eggs and bacon.

On arrival here I was told there are no rooms available due to problems with central reservation. Staff at this hotel apologized and were very friendly indeed offering me to stay at the Hyde Hotel Paddington. If I had only known what to expect there I would have chosen a bridge for the night. Best Western Shaftesbury got me a cab to paddingon hyde hotel. On arrival I was told my new room is on the 5th floor but the elevator is out of service. After having arrived after a long journey via Shaftesbury Best Western and being tired from the journey I was not willing to go up the 5th floor. So I was offered to take the staff lift. A very scary experience. This elevator must have been from the 18th century. Of course it got stuck on 2 1/2 floor. After pressing a few buttons I finally arrived at my room. Well apart from it being clean - there is no phone in the room it was boiling hot the air condition button was just decoration I think. The bathroom was about the size of 4 floor tiles the shower being one of them. The smell in the room was hardly bearable. The only good thing was the plasma TV in the room. Although you had not enough room to move back in order to look at the screen. As it was nearly midnight by now I did not need this anyway. So I decided to go back downstairs to order a wakeup call for 6am the following morning - good job i did. I now found out that my door lock didn't work. This would mean that I when going to my conference the next day I would have to take everything with me. So I asked the staff to repair my door lock. All fine..it was done - by about 1.30 in the morning. While I was waiting for this to be fixed not even a glass of water was offered.. So I finally got some sleep.- When I got back to the hotel the next day after a long days work I decided to take a shower. Well. I never thought it was necessary to take towels to a 4star hotel - I should have done so. There were no towels left in the room PLUS all my private toiletries like medical soap shower gel and shampoo had disappeared. When I mentioned this at checkout I was told there is nothing they can do about it. Thank god it was only toiletries. I had to leave the hotel on each day at 7 am in the mornings. So - no breakfast. Not at 10 to 7. I have stayed in many hotels before and when breakfast was offered from 7 to 9 then I always managed to get some sandwich or egg on toast before 7. Not here. - So overall - Do not book this hotel unless you have to and if you are transferred from another hotel due to problems with booking agencies - try to get another hotel. btw - are neg hotel stars given out to worst hotels these days? I'll give it 10 out of 10. . never again","2013-09-17T13:39:04","131572.0","-2","2013-09-17T10:20:19","ZD111352","Ohio","1958-01-01T00:00","45490","5.0"

The location of the hotel is fantastic a few minutes walk from Russell Sq tube which means you're really in the center of London. Bloomsbury is a lovely part of London it feels pretty safe and there are a few bars cafes and restaurants close to the hotel. You are also walking distance from the British Museum and Soho/West End is about a half hour walk away [for those who don't like the tube]The room was small but clean and with a nice bathroom. It was more than adequate as a place to sleep.The breakfast was great plenty of it and decent coffee!I think with this hotel you stand to get a good deal. The standard of room and the location at the price is great and unless you can afford to spend 2 or 3 times more you'll struggle to get a better hotel in this part of London.

I know my rating is a little low but there were a few things that frustrated me with the hotel and as a result I lowered my rating.The rooms were clean the staff was very friendly and the decor is nice. But they try so hard to be funky hip and cool that they lose the ability to be practical.Some examples for you. They place the face cloths in the sink area and the hand towels in the shower area. Then once I fetch a hand towel I have no place to hang it up in the sink area. It ends up lying on the counter beside the sink.The closet to hang up your clothes consists of a 10 inch bar at a 45 degree angle and little knobs down the bar to catch the hangars. It looks nice and takes up very little room but try using it! It's impossible to manage the cloths on this bar.And finally you're going to shake your head at me for this but you know how all hotels give you a pad of paper and a pen to write with? Well here they still give you the paper but instead of a pen they give you a pencil. Yah a pencil. Try writting a postcard with a pencil and then mailing it.All these things are meant to be inline with the brand but I didn't care for it. Plus there was a problem with the bill (1 night stay with no incidentals and they make a mistake). It was taken care of but it was just another frustration I had to deal with 5 minutes before the shuttle leaves.Oh and that's another thing. The shuttle. If you stay here DO NOT stand at the hotel shuttle post outside the airport. They don't stop here (after 20 minutes of waiting I figured it out). They stop at post #2 called Parking and Via Rail and arrive about every 15 minutes or so. There is a free phone beside the baggage claim to the hotel.There is coffee in your room but only enough to make 1 cup of regular coffee or one cup of decaf. You may have to share.And one last thing do your research for food. Their selection is very limited and quite expensive. We ended up eating at the airport on arrival and departure days.Sorry so negative here when the other posts are so possitive. I guess this is a great hotel for some people but I was just frustrated by it. Although at $105 it was the cheapest one around.","2013-09-17T13:57:39","150133.0","-2","2013-09-17T12:41:36","ZD111574","Washington","1951-01-01T00:00","98346","5.0"

Its a great place to stay as you can visit the party side of the Palms Resort via the Sky Tube or jump in the car and grab some dinner off property. Great staff always very friendly and helpful.","2013-09-17T12:47:19","140825.0","-2","2013-09-17T09:43:30","ZD111409","Alabama","1980-01-01T00:00","35650","5.0"

Based on TA advice we requested previous to our arrival a room on the highest floor and on the backside of the hotel to get away from the noise. We were given room 1011 (Floors 12 &amp; 14 are apparently VIP/expensive rooms). Our view was poor as expected but with the AC on we never heard any noise at night and very little during the day. Loved it. After getting information on activities we were given an offer to see Muir Woods free if we sit through an information spiel •À_updating us on using our benefits•À_. No thanks!The ROOM was an ugly orange and blue as expected but was spacious and comfortable with enough space to put away our clothes and •À_stuff•À_ with ease. 30•À_x 20•À_ refrigerator small microwave toaster coffee maker condiments a couple plates cups and silverware; nice 34-36•À_ widescreen TV DVD player mini music center; USA Today every morning with the San Francisco Chronicle available in the lobby. INTERNET: We used it everyday and never experienced any problems. The BATHROOM was a little smaller than expected. Only 5x8 including the tub/shower combo. The whole room is well planned except for the waste of space across from the bathroom. If the room entrance had been moved from the center the bathroom could have been at least 50% larger. The toilet flushed very loud.The BED was reasonably comfortable but a little hard. We are spoiled with a foam mattress at home. We ended up putting the extra sofa sleeper sheets from the closet on top of the bedding/comforter and then covering ourselves with the extra sheet and blankets. We then slept more comfortably.CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST: See pics - Reg &amp; Nonfat milk/various coffees &amp; teas/tasty OJ; good donuts/pastries/muffins; bananas/apples/oranges; bagels/cream cheese/butter/jams; Many TA folks have complained about the breakfast. Perhaps some do not understand that this is a classic continental breakfast •À_ not a buffet. Nonetheless how hard is it to add little cereal boxes? And regardless of anything else we are in the year 2008 and it is just very poor not to have yogurt which is a staple of quick breakfasts today. If you get in there in the first hour food selection is fine. After that the selection diminishes quickly. The selection also seemed to diminish during the week from Monday to Thursday but then Friday and Saturday were decent. Outside there were 2 tables with 4 &amp; 2 chairs and also 2 lounge chairs. With a light jacket it is very nice to enjoy your meal outside. Inside there are 4 caf•À_ tables with 3 chairs each and also 4 sofa chairs and one sofa. Seating is hit and miss after about 7:30am. We ate there a couple of times otherwise we just brought our food back to the room. FITNESS CENTER: Very minimal EQUIPMENT: 1 stair stepper 1 stationary cycle 1 treadmill set of free weights; meager universal machine scale and water dispenser. Small but adequate separate SAUNAS. You may need to turn it on and then wait 15 minutes or more for it to warm up as I did on all 3 occasions I used it. The aluminum JACUZZI is brand new and a bit small. The first time I could barely fit in with several other people in it. The next 2 occasions there was never more than 1 other person. They have towels locker room showers etc. LOCATION IS EXCELLENT! Just a block from Union Square and 5 blocks from Powell and Market. You can get half-price tickets at TIX in Union Square for numerous plays comedy clubs and entertainment venues. 1 block from Biscuits &amp; Blues where we listened to some great blues. Ruby Skye club across the street.1 1/2 blocks from Colibri Mexican Restaurant which was great. 1 1/2 blocks from the American Conservatory Theater which is a very nice theater where we saw •À_Rock n•À_ Roll•À_.1 1/2 blocks from the Curran Theater which was a decent theater in which we saw •À_Spring Awakening•À_. 1 Block from Honey Honey Caf•À_ &amp; Crepery which is great for a sandwich or burger and excellent for an omelet or a crepe. Innumerable eating shopping and entertainment establishments very close by. MASSAGE 4 blocks from the Union Square Stress Reduction Center (on Sutter before Kearny) where we both got an excellent massage for $50 per hour •À_ if you don•À_t want to spend a ridiculous $105 per hour at this hotel. If your calves hurt like ours this was almost a necessity.IF YOU WALK places like we love to do and you are here for more than a couple days we highly suggest that you take the cable car or buses when going upward or downward. We both jog/walk a couple times a week. Nonetheless walking up and down the hills now and then during our stay caused both of us significant and unusual discomfort in our legs and shins after a couple of days. We used the sauna and Jacuzzi only 3 times but we needed to use it every single day. TRANSPORTATION: Unless you are traveling away from San Francisco driving is completely unnecessary and probably frustrating. Public transportation is fun and inexpensive. The MUNI pass is only $24 for seven days. We highly recommend the City Pass for $59 which includes the 7-day MUNI pass and the $25 admission to the California Academy of Sciences (a MUST SEE!) a 1-hour bay cruise which is cool and a few other good attractions. Last year we stayed at the Le Meridien Hotel on Battery Street near Embarcadero Plaza and Pier 1. It is a better hotel with a great location too. However given a choice of the two at the same price we would stay at the Donatello because the location is the best and the free internet which we used to explore SF every day.","2013-09-17T14:58:18","102185.0","0","2013-09-17T11:49:26","ZD111385","Arizona","2008-01-01T00:00","85007","5.0"

The mattress was virtullay unsleepable and the bedding had cigarette burns on it. The rest of the furniture was at least 15 years old and in bad shape. The cableTV didn't even receieve CBS FOX NBC and ABC. Not to mention not even a movie station. The shower went from extream cold to extreamly hot like someone was flushing the toilet over and over.

Please be careful if you take a taxi from the airport to the hotel we got overcharged it cost $24 plus a tip because they guy went via the freeway on the return to the airport it cost only $9 plus a tip!The suite was wonderful with a balcony very quite TV in bathroom bath robes etc •À_ it was such a great way to start a holiday. Very clean and quiet. The reception and bell boy were very pleasant and on checkout the receptionist let us choose our room for our next stay in 2.5 weeks for our other stay for 2 nights on our return leg.Our second stay didn•À_t start too good (we had chosen a 28th floor 1 bed suite in tower 1 when checking out of our first stay) but on our return leg at check in we found we had been moved to tower 2 in a lower floor. The receptionist was very rude and asked for ID and all sorts of information where as on our first stay they didn•À_t ask for that information.Because we had booked our stays nearly a year in advance before the resort fee had increased our first stay was kept at the same rate yet this receptionist tried to tell us we had to pay the increased rate •À_ not what you want to hear when you•À_ve just driven for 7 hours! We didn•À_t pay the increased rate in the end and it made us glad we didn•À_t stay in Tower 2 as I wouldn•À_t have wanted to speak to her again!We managed to change back to tower 1 •À_ 28th floor but since we had arrived at tower 2 had to carry all our baggage to tower 1! Not the best start.The cleaning of the 1 bed suite was a little disappointing I opened the door to find a rag and bathmat behind the door and what looked like plaster dust in various places in the room. However this was soon forgotten when we started to explore the room it was fantastic with two bathrooms and a TV that comes out of the desk and also a dishwasher it was wonderful.The next day I had to ask for our room to be cleaned luckily we had arrived back in the room about 3:30pm and requested our room to be serviced so it wasn•À_t too inconvenient but I am not sure if they would have come. (a little worrying as I did put the service button on when we left at 8am).The pool was quite nice it had complimentary water which was a nice touch. We were dissapointed that we didn't get any water in our car when we used the vallet.Check out went well we paid our sundry costs in cash but it was later charged to my credit card then refunded •À_ strange but at least they didn•À_t charge us again.Overall it was a great stay and the BIG plus side to this hotel is that it doesn't not smell of smoke when you walk through it. As none smokers it was horrible walking into the other hotels and coming out smelling of smoke. We wouldn•À_t stay at the Bellagio because of that if we went again we would defiantly stay at this hotel.","2013-09-17T13:31:52","114084.0","-4","2013-09-17T11:01:14","ZD111498","California","1994-01-01T00:00","92257","5.0"

Once with my wife and once taking 4 rooms (2 customers and a colleague). 1st stay I took one of the amazingly modern new room conversions on the 1st floor. (Exec). Its open plan and once you get used to the fact the loo and shower are simply in the room behind their own frosted glass its really quiet good. So not Hilton. Its like being in a boutique hotel. But.....and isnt there always the rooms face onto Aldwych and are just at double Decker bus height. There's more frosted glass to the windows so no-one stares in but there is no shutting out the traffice noise. If you dont care about the noise I'd really recommend trying one of these rooms. As good as Firmdale Hotels (Google that and you will see what I mean). Anyway my wife and I are actually over the top about noise so next time I went I got an exec room that faces inward. Totally silent and junior suite sized space. Breakfast is above average. - free as usual in the exec lounge but actuallly worth passing up. The almost silver service standard full english in the splendid main restaurant is worth experiencing. Don't bother with the spa its outsourced and is a serious weight pumpers paradise. Go there if you are fitness fanatic it actually smelt of sweat in the changing rooms. Not dirty but businesslike where business is proper exercise.I prefer luxury.Really this is not your typical Hilton.","2013-09-17T12:20:32","121257.0","4","2013-09-17T09:38:08","ZD111337","California","1972-01-01T00:00","90814","5.0"

I returned to the same suite to find nothing had changed not even the decor.

They just cannot do enough to help you. I required a bit of assistance and they were OUTSTANDING in every way. They will always be my default choice. You might get a fancier lobby or a trendier room but you won't get better service.

First trip was good once I figured out why it was so expensive from the airport for a round-trip. Note: It's on Boulder Highway quite a little ways from the Strip.Stayed for 2 nights (comp sent in the mail) and also received a $25 food coupon for buffet or steakhouse. Upon arriving I was checked in by the absolute nicest front desk clerk Lisa. She was very prompt about taking my information and assigning me a room. We even visited over why I was there and playing Bingo (which I didn't win...and she said she had given up on because she never wins anyways!). She informed me that my original request of a King wouldn't be available but that was OK. I was given room #333. It was interesting because it was tucked away in a corner by itself. I was OK with that. Now the best part....I asked Lisa if I could obtain a funbook. She slipped me one. Now that's customer service!Rooms are nice casino is large (2 levels) and Bingo hall is fun. They have a shuttle service that runs to Harrah's and the Rivieria on the Strip as well as California and Fremont downtown. Highly recommend using this just beware of schedules (which you can get at the front desk). If not you can still get back by using the CAT buses (but remember its on Boulder so it will take some time to get back).Steakhouse was great but ate a little too much as I had to spend the $25...beware appetizers are large than appears sometimes :).","2013-09-17T13:32:54","105938.0","2","2013-09-17T12:54:47","ZD111319","California","1953-01-01T00:00","95015","5.0"

Also close to Borough Market.There is a shop next door to hotel which sells newspapers/snacks etc but no alcohol. Walk bit further down road and there is a costcutter.To avoid to train tracks request a room not over looking them. They usuall accomodate if not too busy. You wont have a view (building oppo) but will have a very quiet night sleep - heard no noise. Room 418!!

Staying at the Milano was a last-minute call for me. I was supposed to stay with a girlfriend but had to move out when she and the boyfriend had a tiff. So my room was a freebie (the least my friend could do for me) but the meals were on me. This place is at the heart of downtown SF and the shopping was simply paces away! Even the jump-offs for the requisite sites like Fisherman's Wharf Alcatraz etc were close by. The rooms were just the right side of cozy and very clean especially the bathrooms. Service was spotty on the first day Sunday maybe they were operating on a skeleton crew but by Monday till Wednesday (check-out day) things were smooth.

What a difference the sun makes. Last stay was in November and it was freezing. Staff were brilliant they are so knowlegable. I had plenty questions. Thanks to the NY forum we caught the airbus then the subway to the hotel from JFK for $7. We had a double room with a queen size bed. A really comfy mattrass. We were there for 5 nights. The room was cleaned every day and towels were replaced daily. Empty fridge which is a bonus as you can stock up from the nearby supermarket. Breakfast was excellent value for $4. We only had to queue once for 5 mins.We were in a party of 11 and everyone enjoyed their stay.The only fault was the 7am wake up call from the building works next door weekdays only but on the plus side it gave us more time to explore this wonderful city.","2013-09-17T15:03:16","135533.0","-2","2013-09-17T12:15:50","ZD111292","Hawaii","1993-01-01T00:00","96817","5.0"

First time in Bellagio this time in the four seasons at Mandalay Bay. The Hotel was fantastic with its own private pool area away from the big groups at Mandalay Bay although you can use both pools. If you have kids Mandalay bay is better as it has a massive pool with wave machine if you are a couple and want peace and quiet the Four seasons every time.The hotel is situated right at the South end of the strip which has it's advantages in that you are out of the way so no really big crowds but makes going up and down the strip a bit longer walk. If you are 20's - 40's you are fine if you are over 60 stay in the middle of the strip to save the legs :-).I would recommend the hotel to anyone when we go back this would be very high on my list of were to stay but we might try the new Palazzo or Encore as they both looked great hotels when we went and looked at them.","2013-09-17T14:37:55","129895.0","3","2013-09-17T10:16:26","ZD111573","Hawaii","1995-01-01T00:00","96862","5.0"

Wanted a central hotel but not too expensive. Was slightly concerned after reading the reviews however.....Got to the Time at 1430. Was advised the room wasnt ready but wouldnt be long. 5 minutes later the bellboy took our bags and we were off to the 15th floor. As this was a special occassion I had arranged the Romance package which was a bottle of champagne rose petals and Godiva chocolates. They had put the petals on the bedspread with the chocolates in the middle - very impressed. The room was bigger than I was expecting - bed extremly comfortable nice bathroom big tv. The only criticism would be the lack of storage there was a wardrobe but no drawers. The hotel was just off times square and approx 5 minutes from times square subway. Great location.The housekeeping staff were very thorough. We loved the fact that the Do Not Disturb sign was part of the doorbell - very original. Also different to another review we thought that the fact the beds were turned down the blinds put down and chocolate and the weather report left a really nice touch - especially for a 3 star property.We had a problem with our mini bar making a noise. We advised reception and within half hour it had been fixed apart from that no problem at all.We used room service thought the $5 delivery charge was a bit cheeky as this wasnt mentioned anywhere but the food was good and was with us within 15 minutes.Overall the hotel was lovely the room good value for money - the room rate was $229 a night - compared to $400 at other hotels in the area. If like us you are coming to NYC for the sights and dont plan on spending a lot of time in your room then this is definately the hotel for you - foget the negative reviews - I wouldnt hesitate on coming back.Room 1518 from 27/2 to 2/3","2013-09-17T14:28","155850.0","5","2013-09-17T11:53:35","ZD111174","Illinois","2018-01-01T00:00","60085","5.0"

They were vgery comfortable -clean bed linen - rooms well polished and dusted - good showers - and not expensive at all for Central London - doubles at around •À_49 Plus they took some family rooms at under •À_75 plus 3x3 rooms at under •À_60. Nice breakfast too - soft boiled eggs toast and cereals. 4 of our party stayed in another Hotel close-by and they paid a LOT more and only got a stale roll! Plus - the really good point was that they were able to use the kitchen for warm-ups bought a few yeards away at Marks and Spencer's - and could also make tea at any time (vital for the Aunts!). Staff helped our older members with luggage - and one ground floor room for our elderly two aunts was provided as promised. It's a small and honest-to-goodness B&amp;B - not the big hotel experience - where double rooms cost •À_80-90 per night - so you cannot expect room service etc. - just a great location and clean rooms. The staff showed us their guest book and it is full of reccommendations and return stays from all corners of the globe. We decided to post these comments because we think that generally guests who are happy with hotels don't bother! It's only those with 'gripes' who take the trouble - so reviewss can be one-sided. We've looked at a couple of these posted in November and just don't agree - though there are some very nice family postings during the summer. We'll reccommend - and rebook for out Wedding later on in 2007. Thanks to all the staff!

Now to be fair it wasn't all bad in fact there were many positive aspects toour stay. The room was of a reasonable size the hotel clean and the staf by enlarge pleasent and responsive to our requests and enquiries. Again the continental breakfast was adequate and facilities good. However when an hotel quotes in its lierature that their ethos is to provide good clean accomodation at a reasonable price where everything works and then it doesn't that irks. Our roomhad non-functioning lights a badly cracked wash basin a kettle whichbroke down on first use and housekeeping who had not cleaned our roomby 2.00pm then obviously not everything worked. We had two doors to the room with a gap between to cusion noise which was very good. But one door didn't close properly on its automatic closure and had to bepulled closed while the other had fallen on its hinges and jammed against the upper part of the frame and again needed to be pulled closed with a hefty tug. Add to that the fact that an English Breakfast costs •À_4.00 extra for scrambled egg and bacon and this does not constitute good value either. Along with that was the frustration of a long narrow dining room with a buffet breakfast (either EB or continental) which meant shuffling up and down squeezing past other breakfasters to get to your selected table. Now the location of this hotel is good near to both attractions and transport links and while we were there the area seemed pleasently quiet. But don't expect perfection or anything near. Things could be a lot better with a more responsive menagement and a good maintenanceperson. GM.

Last year we stayed at the Millennium Hilton right next to ground zero - which was nice very expensive and we had been warned about the 24 hr. construction noise. Went searching for a hotel this year and based on it's reviews alone I booked Gild Hall and I'm glad I did. Let's put it this way: 2 nights here cost me slightly more than 1 night at the Millennium last year. The bartender on Friday night informed us that it had been converted from a Holiday Inn about a year ago to a Thompson hotel. Rooms were cozy modern clean and comfortable. Good water pressure in the shower and a nice flat screen on the wall of the room. Really what more can you ask for?

We are able to leave an evening concert and within 2 •À_ 3 minutes be back into our hotel room or apartment. On entering The John Howard we have always found the reception staff very friendly co-operative and helpful. When being shown to our room or apartment via the lifts we appreciate the absence of long corridors with many little identical rooms leading from them. Each room or apartment at the J.H. is an individual and always found to be very clean comfortable spacious and well equipped. A very substantial English breakfast is included or if preferred a lighter comprehensive continental breakfast is also provided. The John Howard No.4. Queens Gate is also conveniently situated near to other places of interest. Hyde Park is just yards away Kensington Palace 5 minutes. walk through the park Kensington High Street 5 minutes walk and has many shops and restaurants . In the other direction 8 Minutes walk to Exhibition Road with all the museums including The Victoria and Albert. Further on still within walking distance Knightsbridge and Harrods.

The Chicago O'Hare Hilton has always provided my room preferences and their beds are something to die for.I've stayed at a lot of Hilton hotels but this one has the best beds/pillows in the world. Don't even think of watching TV in bed you will be asleep in minutes. Despite my past bad review the bed was the same HEAVEN standard.Room was very clean past guest had drop a smoke and burnt the carpet for the length of a cigarette but nothing you can expect the Hilton to fix quickly not really a worry.Room had it's own ADSL2 modem on the desk standard $9.95 fee but as per my last stay had issues with multiple connections. You would get timeouts on pages if you tried to view too many at once. Rather annoying and time consuming if you like loading many pages at once or pages with lots of images Flickr had alot of issues both times.This hotel has the best Coffee machine I've experienced they even give you a take-away cup if you want to brew an on the go run checkout.As I was looking for a 11am checkout a window washer came by about 10am would have been nice if the hotel warned people. Being male I wasn't too concerned but females would think differently. I was taking Airport photos so this was a bonus for me.This is the only Hilton Hotel I really look forward to returning to. The beds alone are worth it despite a 5 hour sleep you wake up feeling like you slept a week refreshed and renewed.","2013-09-17T13:29:38","128504.0","-5","2013-09-17T12:46:21","ZD111560","Montana","1969-01-01T00:00","59421","5.0"

Similar to my last stay I had a Deluxe King City View room. As a nice surprise I ended up on the Mission St. side which had a clear view of the Bay Bridge.Room furnishings were still in great shape. This room had a chaise type chair instead of the sofa in my prior room. Flat-screen TV is great as usual. Only drawback they don't have a HDTV signal so the image is stretched to fit the screen aspect ratio.Interesting item...on my original stay housekeeping stopped by for turndown service. This time none was offered. Not sure if this service was elimianted or not.Only kinks were as follows: wake-up call was 10 minutes late shoes (after a complimentary overnight shoe shine) were not returned on time and they missed delivering me the morrning paper. Not traumatic on the grand scheme of things but definitely not common for a hotel of this caliber. They'll get better with age...just start-up issues in my estimation. If not for these minor glitches I would have given 5 stars.","2013-09-17T14:21:52","127740.0","-1","2013-09-17T11:35:31","ZD111231","New Hampshire","2013-01-01T00:00","3811","5.0"

The only thing they seem to have missed in the room is somewhere to hang the hand towels??? Oh and no free biscuits!...but then they do have free apples in reception internet is free!!!! too and free Daily telepgraph. Warm welcoming and a great full English breakfast.

We wanted a family break during Twixmas for 2 adults and a 12 yearold - who was to celebrate his 13th birthday whilst we were away!The room was a Superior room with a large double bed and unusually for a hotel a VERY comfortable single bed.We loved the fact that we had loads of space in our room. Unlike cheaper hotels the wardrobe had doors so everything was neatly hidden away. The small kitchenette also hidden behind doors had a fridge sink kettle and microwave which enabled us to cook breakfast and an evening meal! The bathroom was spotless and the shower hot and powerful.What was quite unique was the interactive TV with all the free to air digital channels plus free intenet access internet radio its own mini i-tunes with all manner of cd's and games pre loaded and free to play. The movies cost just •À_2 each. I know London has rather a lot of attractions but it was nice to come back to our room and have plenty of entertainment whilst we relaxed.The other unique feature was the fact that we had 3 totally uninterrupted nights sleep! No slamming of doors no shouting down the corridors no heavy footsteps from the room above despite the hotel being full during our stay. The area felt safe at night. M&amp;S and Waitrose were 2 mins away as was Earls court Station and Harrods was only a 15 min walk along Cromwell Road.We will definitly be returning in the summer for another short break.","2013-09-17T12:28:56","116974.0","-4","2013-09-17T12:42:21","ZD111398","North Carolina","1979-01-01T00:00","27705","5.0"

Our room wasn't ready why ask for your arrival time if it makes no difference? We were told we could leave our bags in the luggage room a scabby room with no lock and no concierge.The room - you leave the bright airy reception when the lift doors open you get some idea what you're in for. At once you are hit with the smell of stale tobacco smoke.The room was small which isn't the end of the world but the bathroom was VILE the grout black the light fighting above the mirror was rusty the hairdryer pathetic and wrapped with duck tape. The sink didnt have a grate and didnt drain properly there was dirt behind the taps. The toilet didn't flush everytime.The radiators in the hallways were on high - with the thermostat knob broken.Breakfast - Continental? Really? Whilst there was nothing wrong with the breakfast it does not qualify as continental. Toast tea cereal - when there is milk in the jug and spoons in the pot. Fruit juice and one choice of yoghurt.","2013-09-17T14:29:54","117880.0","-1","2013-09-17T11:30:04","ZD111449","Ohio","1960-01-01T00:00","44189","5.0"

Everything was confirmed and explained so that no additional hidden expenses were encountered (unlike some other hotels we•À_ve stayed in).With a party of 4 adults and 2 kids we booked 3 double rooms with two of the rooms adjoining. The double rooms provided would easily pass as executive rooms in other hotel establishments. Rooms were spotlessly clean and tidy with fresh modern d•À_cor.The bathroom was very clean and modern with the molten &amp; brown toiletries giving the hotel a further touch of class. The bathrobes provided were a pleasant surprise.The beds have got to be the most comfortable I have slept in at a hotel.

The Italian restaurant is suberb - one night we also ate in the upstairs pizzeria. My only criticism is that it would improve by increasing its choice of pizzas and starters as the menu is quite limited -although outside setting beautiful. The main restaurant Blue Orange is consistently good with a wide choice of food that changes nightly. The main highlight ironically was the only restaurant we never ate in on our last visit. Hunters Grill provided a fantastic setting and a great choice for carnivores - so good we went 2 nights in a row - the manager recognised this and came over with a complimentary glass of champagne - a lovely touchWe had booked a club room and on the first evening (even before setting foot in the lounge) we passed one of the lounge hosts in the main hotel corridor who stopped us and welcomed us back - considering the number of people she must see in and out of the lounge it was again a lovely touch and made us feel welcome - I think this person's name was Lalu.The lounge service was intuitively good - we never had to ask for a drink refill - there was always one being prepared - the only thing and it is a small thing - the canape selection consisted of too many sandwiches and not enough bitesoverall a great hotel and will be back","2013-09-17T13:27:56","108859.0","-4","2013-09-17T09:39:52","ZD111355","Tennessee","1953-01-01T00:00","37224","5.0"

The front desk staff was helpful as could be. 6:00 pm - The happy hour was great free drinks nachos chips and popcorn. 12:30 am - Used hotel pc's in the business center to try and look up information on a mainly GLBT club. The site was blocked because it contained the forbidden word lesbian. Facebook was also blocked. Is this the US or China? I'll never stay at another Embassy Suites again. That perhaps goes for any Hilton Honors hotel depending on what I find out about GLBT sites being blocked. 1:00 am - Went to bed. I could hear my neighbors particularly the ones above me in their bath the water running hair dryer everything. There was also some strange loud noise like furniture being moved on a tile floor. It went on for some time. There were various other noises as well. 7:00 am - Woke up. The strange noise started again. Maybe it was kids blowing on something. With that and the noise from the other rooms there was no hope of going back to sleep.

For this the value of the hotel was excellent I requested and got 2 double beds and a fridge for medication that I carry this was all sorted out before we arrived for which i was most grateful. The staff were excllent friendly and helpful especially Luz on the front desk. The room was spacious the beds supremely comfortable we had no problem with the width of the walls as some previous travellers have indicated this may just be floor specific we were on the 5th floor.

We had consideredDubai before but not at this time of year due to the extreme temperature. Destinology found us a bargain at very short notice so we set off loaded with suntan lotion.Tripadvisor.com has been glued to my monitor since May. We•À_ve checkedout almost every hotel in the world (it felt like it). The Ritz-Carlton had a lot t live up to. We wanted a five star hotel with a five star beach and five star food. Our frame of reference is large we•À_ve stayed at five star hotels all over the world.Dubai airport is large and sprawling bigger than I expected but modern and clean. We were met by our transfer agent who had a car waiting to take us directly to the hotel. Transfer time was about 30 mins. We arrived at the hotel at midnight and were shown to the club lounge to check in.Even as late as we arrived staff were on hand to open our car doors and take our luggage. We were ushered through the magnificent foyer to the front desk where they found our reservation for a Club room before adjourning upstairs. A club lounge hostess/concierge greeted us by name and offered us champagne. No sparkling wine at the Ritz! Moet Chandon no less. The check in process took around 10 minutes. We were shown to our room when we were ready.We stayed in a club sea view king room no 507. It was an excellent room. Very large for a standard including a couch with coffee table desk with internet connection and two large chairs Samsung LCD TV and DVD player a fridge that worked a separate dressing area double vanity bath and walk in shower. The balcony wasn•À_t largebut it was too hot to sit out anyway. The air-conditioning in the hotel was excellent. Given that the temperature outside most days was 115 - 120 F the rooms especially were cool and welcoming. We had our own control panel that worked precisely. Included in the cost of a club room is the use of the exclusive club lounge. Situated on the sixth floor you can only access it from the lift using your room key (the lift only goes up to the fourth floor without the insertion of a club level room key). The club lounge is large and comfortable with various couches and tables. There are six food presentations daily starting with •À_Full American Breakfast•À_-I wouldn•À_t call it full exactly but it was fine- and ending with canap•À_s and cocktails. They provided a large variety of food which was beautifully displayed and too tempting. The club staff always made sure we had whatever we wanted to drink. Champagne whisky. Tea coffee lots of water! We were both very impressed with the selection. They had various scotch whisky•À_s and my favourite tipple Jameson•À_s Irish whiskey. The tea was amazing also organic Moroccan tea in stitched silk purses worth the extra club fee on their own. We found that we preferred to go into the city for a meal in the evenings rather than eat nibbles all day however you could easily make a meal of the club presentations.The club staff were professional and efficient of course and also friendly. We were only there a week but by the end we knew all of their names where they were from and their plans for the future. They helped to make it a wonderful holiday. We had no idea where to eat in Dubai it being our first trip. There was a very helpful booklet in our room with the best restaurants of 2007 but the best recommendations came from the club staff. They made us various reservations at MJ•À_s the Buddah Bar Spectrum on One and the Burj Al Arab etc. We were treated like royalty at each place we went to. I don•À_t know if it•À_s because the Ritz-Carlton had made the reservation? In the Skyview bar at the Burj we were shown to possibly the best table in the place. We could hear others grumbling •À_How did they get to sit there when we have to sit here?•À_ We had four waiters show us to our table after a guided tour of the restaurant Spectrum on One. The list goes on.The pool areas and the beach were excellent. We only ventured over to the sea a couple of times as it was just too hot to stray too far from the pool. The sand is clean and white as per the Caribbean but far too hot to stand on. The sea is clear and blue but hotter than I take my bath. Watch out for jellyfish. There is plenty of space around the pools. There is a quiet spa pool a little removed from the rest a kids pool and water slide and the main pool with water features and swim up bar. There were always plenty of beds to choose from even though the hotel was booked to capacity. Next to the pool there are large manicured lawns with more beds. We were brought cold towels cooling body sprays and melon snacks periodically. A large bottle of Evian will cost about •À_4 and it comes in an ice bucket with glasses. The staff there can•À_t do enough for you. Ok Dubai is fairly expensive. It will cost you •À_16 for a glass of champagne at the pool •À_5 for a beer or •À_10 for a cocktail but it•À_s worth every penny. The hotel is superb the best I•À_ve stayed in. The staff are exceptional. The club is a must. When you see enormouscrowded hotels everywhere you realize what a good choice you made. Dubai is a building site but it•À_s still stunning. There is practically no crime. You can walk safely anywhere in the city at any time and it•À_s wonderful. The people of Dubai are kind generous and welcoming. We will definitely be back.","2013-09-17T13:26:45","114239.0","-5","2013-09-17T12:14:31","ZD111258","Virginia","1952-01-01T00:00","22015","5.0"

I stay in Marriott Hotels on a weekly basis in the UK and I found this hotel a refreshing change.It is compact and chic hotel within a stones throw of Times Square and I haven't got a very long throw. The rooms are an adequate size but if you want bigger rooms then pay in excess of $300 per night for that luxury. NYC is not known for super size hotel rooms. The rooms have everything you need. TV CD player fridge storage telephone Air Con and a shower/wet room. There is no kettle/coffee making facilties but you will find the same in most NY hotels room service is an income provider afterall. If you need coffee after breakfast is served then Starbucks is right across the road actually wherever you are in NY Starbucks is right across the road! At night you will get a good nights sleep on a very comfortable bed with no noise from the streets below. As a bonus the beds have full quilts instead of tightly tucked in layer on layer of sheets. The rooms are cleaned daily.Breakfast is more than adequate with a wide selection of fruit cereals and pastries. But if you are here as a tourist and eating breakfast in your hotel you're missing the point. Diners are everywhere get out and enjoy a well priced breakfast at one of the many diners to be found including the one next door.The staff are all marvellous. From the Receptionists to the maids. All have a smile and a friendly greeting at any time of day. Somebody is available 24 hours and reception can help with advice on everything.After a day visiting the sights or shopping your feeting will be throbbing and your throat dry. So treat yourself to a dip in the heated pool whilst enjoying a drink from the poolside bar. The bar is popular at night but without becoming a mini nightclub.So you have it all. A great location very comfy beds lovely staff and all at bargain price. Try it it will enhance your stay in a fantastic city.No I'm not being paid by Andree Balazs for this review.

I have never stayed in a Premier Inn before. I have always been in favour of spending money in pricey boutique hotels featured on Mr. and Mrs. Smith etc. However from the moment we checked in we immediately noticed how modern and clean the hotel was. It was spotless and very spacious - everything you want from a hotel on a short break in the city. Unfortunately Sunday night I woke up feeling very unwell and continued to be very ill throughout the night and the next day with food poisoning (having eaten outside the hotel). Being in London and paying so little for a hotel I was apprehensive about phoning reception and asking for late check-out. To my surprise the receptionist was incredibly kind and understanding allowing me to check out two and a half hours late and calling a doctor for me. He also brought me some toast to my room so that I wouldn't have to take my painkillers on an empty stomach! I was overwhelmed by how sweet they were to me and will not forget how much they helped me out that day. A great hotel that I cannot fault even if I hadn't of been ill.","2013-09-17T11:29:35","124785.0","-1","2013-09-17T11:38:38","ZD111203","Wisconsin","2007-01-01T00:00","54307","5.0"

We were on the 2nd floor and the noise was unbelievable with car horns blasting police car sirens and carbage trucks all through the night. I suppose thats what you get for choosing a hotel on 5th Avenue. Perhaps being higher up it would not have been so bad. I read the reviews about the room being small but was still suprised how small they were. When you open the door it nearly touches the bed. The room was spotlessly clean and also the bathroom. No coffee or tea making facilities in the room which I hadn't realised when I booked (we love our cup of tea before bed and first thing). The front staff where friendly and polite and checked us in for our flights and printed out the boarding . The hotel is in a great position for everthing but I don't think I would stay there again. I think I would rather pay the extra and have the comforts of a wardrobe tea/coffee facilities fridge etc. and definetly less noise.","2013-09-17T14:10:04","115410.0","3","2013-09-17T12:18:42","ZD111475","California","1990-01-01T00:00","91356","5.0"

Don't trust the concierge Tony to book your transportation from the airport. The website says he will take care of it upon request. I talked to him on the phone and requested a town car pick up ($55). He said he would arrange it but no car was there when we arrived. When I called the hotel Tony was on vacation and John who was overseeing the concierge duties knew nothing about it. John suggested I find a cab. After expressing much disappointment John got a town car to the airport in about 20 minutes. For an extra $10 the driver stopped at a fabulous grocery so we could get some wine cheese fruit and crackers for our arrival party at the hotel. Upon our arrival we asked John to compensate us for the inconvenience. He gave us a $100 credit for the mix up which we felt was generous. We stayed in room 1303 which was the one bedroom suite. The living room area had 3 huge windows for great views even a peak of the bay but 2 of the windows were very dirty which obstructed the view. However the window facing the Mark Hopkins was clean and it was entertaining to watch the people try to walk the very steep hill after a night of partying. The furnishings are tired the bed lumpy the towels thin but it was nice to have a living room when someone wanted to go to bed earlier. We bought the 3 day muni pass at the airport ($18) and took the cable car everywhere. The cab ride arranged by William back to the airport was $40 w/o tip. I would definitely stay here again considering the large size of the suite and the very small price. If you want luxury go sit in the lobby of the nearby Fairmount Hotel. Oh yes don't forget to go to Tadish's for dinner before you leave town and of course sit at the bar of the Buena Vista at the cable car turnaround for an irish coffee. SF is a great place to visit at Christmas. The tree at Neiman's is a must see.","2013-09-17T11:44:12","122009.0","-1","2013-09-17T10:16:54","ZD111229","California","2001-01-01T00:00","92409","5.0"

Room was clean great service and the only complaint is the pull out couch. It was NOT comfortable. But the rest of the trip made up for it. Our best day was when walking to Grand Central we made a wrong turn and ended up in Hells Kitchen. We met some elderly locals at coffee shop and that was a highlight of NYC. We did all the tourist spots shopped loved Chinatown and Little Italy and shopped some more! 3 major thunderstorms added to excitement! We saw 4 plays and that too was a highlight. Try the Hop on Hop Off bus-2 days is enough and then we travelled by cab. Inexpensive. Food was pricey but quantities just too large. One dish of anything will feed 3 ladies. Beware and don't over order. We felt very safe at all times and did not use the underground. Grab your girlfriends bid adios to the men and fly off to NYC.

I am a wheelchair user and found no reviews that were useful for me in choosing a hotel for this purpose so I decided on the Arabian Courtyard. The reviews were pretty good and it was reasonable. It was advertised as wheelchair friendly and it was except for the bathroom. There was no shower just a bath with one (only) grabrail. This complys with the local regulations and they say allows the room to be classed as accessible. It certainly would not meet the European standard. As the bath was not suitable for me it was a week of me having to wash with a sponge etc....on the whole;-s *reasonable and flexible as all 3 of us (girls) shared a room. One of the party left to embark on her Australia trip and they let us stay in the same room.* Clean* Great indian restrurant* Breakfast included but room service b'fast was good &amp; reasonable.* Close to the textile markets* Staff very helpful in securing taxis etc...assisting with the wheelchair* Spa was superb* Lobby coffee shop excellent for a tea/coffee/pastry &amp; v good /plesant service. * Opposite the Museum which was well worth a visit.-s*noisy - we were over the indian restruant and indian music was audible until 3am!* The restruant (not Thai or indian - the other one) eventhough was OK at breakfast was not good for dinner* The computer time could have been more flexible -eg a charge per day rather than per hour as we did need to use and were charged up to three times a day* Pool not accessible(3 steps up) and sporadic food service there eventhough there is a menu.* Hairdresser (which I had to use due to lack of shower...) was expensive and suspiciously quiet.............Overall it probably wasn't the best hotel for me as a wheelchair user but I do think it was good for the price.

Room service was excellent and were made up and cleaned thoroughly every day of our stay. Sheets were changed at least twice and nothing was missed. Fresh soap mini shampoos etc were replaced every day. Housekeeping staff were very friendly and helpful. Front office staff were a bit aloof and I feel they could be a little bit more helpful at times. The location was great and convenient to all attractions taxis are everywhere and most drivers are more than helpful to visitors. The theater diner up the street was great as was the little diner right next door to the Travel Inn. All in all I would reccommend the hotel as good clean convenient &amp; great value for money.","2013-09-17T13:16:15","113164.0","1","2013-09-17T10:49:27","ZD111378","Illinois","2007-01-01T00:00","60448","5.0"

Biggest problem at the time of our visit was that the hotel is so spanking new (about 1 month old) that the chemical fumes from paint carpets furniture etc. were overwhelming and caused us to check out prematurely after just the first night. Expect the fumes problem will be solved in time although with A/C as only source of air circulation it may take a while. Once the air clears this hotel should be a great choice if you're looking for modern chic cool.","2013-09-17T12:53:55","118880.0","3","2013-09-17T10:39:34","ZD111289","Kansas","2001-01-01T00:00","66601","5.0"

You're also walking distance to Battery Park if you're playing tourist and plan on visiting the Statue of Liberty. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous and staying on the 29th floor had incredible views of the river and the World Trade Center site (the hotel goes well above 50 or 60 floors). The pullout sofa and bed were incredibly comfortable the housekeeping staff was very attentive and the flat screen tvs in each room were a great perk.

The furniture was older and the sofa bed was in need of replacing or certainly repairs but otherwise we were very happy with it and the location is perfect. A safe neighbourhood to go out in and right next to the express subway station at 72nd. The Woogo is run as serviced apartments and not as a hotel so you shouldn't expect the same services as a hotel. There are shops just round the corner to buy things like loo roll and washing up liquid etc. (they provide hand soap and a couple of loo rolls plus towels and sheets - maybe worth packing an extra towel) We found the front desk staff very polite and the night porter was a really nice friendly man.

The room service was very expensive and the variety of late night dining was VERY limited in the Hotel/Casino. The price to stay at this hotel is absolutely not worth it your better off to stay at the Excalibur next door for half the price. The hotel also charges a resort fee that you do not have the option to purchase they make you pay $25.00 per night per room for access to the pools and a newspaper and 2 bottles of water.

No complaints. All 3 rooms were clean and decent size. Location was great central to everything. Hotel was very quiet. We were on the 24th floor and didn't hear any outside noise.The only complaint I have with this hotel is that I left my pillow in the room upon checkout. When I realized I had left my pillow I contacted the hotel and there was no report of my pillow being left in the room. After leaving the city approximately 10 minutes later I was contacted by phone that my pillow was found and I would need to pay for them to deliver it to me. I don't know why it took them 5hours to find the pillow after the room was cleaned. Also I have left items behind before and the hotel has always sent my items at their expensise not mine! I thought this was very tacky and could be a reason why I wouldn't stay at a hotel of this chain again.","2013-09-17T13:12:41","115930.0","-1","2013-09-17T11:25:38","ZD111395","New York","1983-01-01T00:00","11747","5.0"

The room was a triple room and it was nothing special but it was clean. We had a little fridge in the room which was nice to have. The location of this hotel is just about 2 blocks from Victoria Station so it's convenient to anywhere you want to go in London since you can get the subway train there. We went all over town with no problem and we've never been in England before. Also a few blocks down from the hotel is a place to wash clothes which I used TWICE they call it a launderette. That was a nice thing to have nearby. The price for the hotel was outrageously expensive but then so were all the others so we had no choice. The trains coming into the station were VERY loud every 10 minutes or so 24 hours a day.

We trawled the internet for nice hotels in London at a reasonable price and we came across the Crown Moran. Excellent hotel - clean friendly luxurious. Brilliant amenities - swimming pool gym bars... The room (slept 3) was spacious immaculate and had everything we needed except we booked a room for 3 but items such as glasses mugs towels etc were only provided for 2. This didnt ruin our stay however!!! We requested an iron that was delivered to the room at no extra charge. The only downside was we left the room at 9am put the please service the room sign on the door and when we returned at 4pm the room was still not done. Breakfast was great served not only continental but a good old fry up too - set us up for the day! The bus stop outside the hotel provided buses direct to Oxford Circus and Victoria as well as Brent Cross Shopping Centre on the opposite side. We took a bus from the hotel to Victoria at a cost of •À_2 per person (we did hit awful traffic on the way down though!) When going out to Wembley we booked a taxi through the hotel at a cost of •À_15 as there is no direct bus/tube nearby. Cricklewood Broadway offers a range of shops and places to eat and is very pleasant. All in all GREAT value for money (real bargain!) and we have already booked our next trip back minus Take That :-(","2013-09-17T13:32:05","153604.0","-3","2013-09-17T09:48:51","ZD111574","Ohio","2013-01-01T00:00","44860","5.0"

We booked it so that it would be affordable for all couples as this was a some-what last minute decision to go. We chose Tropicana because of its low rate $129/night on Fri. and Sat for Island Tower rooms. And we also chose it because of its excellent location on the strip.Hotel is old-new hotel to be finished from 2010-2012. So I'm glad I've taken the chance to stay at it before they start to demo.We requested our rooms to be close to each other and they managed to get all 3 next to one another. Security in hallway was good. One of the couples kept their door ajar so that we could walk in and out and the security guard came by asking them to keep their doors locked at all times just in case. Which was nice they were looking out for us. Also the first night we checked in one of the rooms on our floor had the smell of marijuana coming from it. We didn't think anything of it and found it kind of amusing. But obviously the hotel did not because security had called the police and kept knocking on the their door and the next day we noticed the smell was gone and they most likely evicted the people who had been in there. Rooms were large and very clean. We could adjust the heat ourselves which is nice. Super quiet!!! We could not hear any outside or hallway noise at all. Housekeeping was good. Carpet was clean and in good condition in the room. Comfortable beds and little sitting area was nice for the guys to hang out together while us girls got ready for the nights out. We were glad we saved our money on rooms and stayed at the Tropicana. We were able to spend the money on good restaurants a show and clubs. Garden Cafe was a good place to get breakfast/Dealers in casino were friendlier than most places/Body exhibit was interesting and enjoyable.I recommend this hotel for those on a budget and just wanting a place to crash at night that is clean. comfortable and quiet.","2013-09-17T13:07:39","116738.0","-5","2013-09-17T09:50:20","ZD111378","Oklahoma","1997-01-01T00:00","74344","5.0"

Granted that it is still in the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Base2Stay was off Earl's Court road - cross the road from Earl's Court tube turn right walk down Earl's Court Gardens and turn left at the first junction. Base2Stay is a refurbished series of townhouses with narrow hallways and a ladyrinth of rooms. But the decor is clean modern and blended well with the white-washed columns and walls on the outside. The room was small and rather cramped for 3 persons. It would have been just nice for a double. It was evident that the room was designed for a double with there being 2 standard single beds with a diven and headboards et al and one foldable / collapsible single bed squeezed between the work desk and the 2 standard single beds.To save space the small kitechenette is built into the wall like a cupboard and space saving furniture used e.g. wall mounted LCD telly half-size stool in place of a chair or sofa etc.The bathroom thankfully is a decent size.Furnishing is of a good quality and overall the stay was comfortable albeit a little cramped at times. Base2Stay was very unlike other horror stories of townhouse-converted-into-hotels in other parts of central London where peeling paint overhanging wires and generally dingy decor were the order of the day.","2013-09-17T12:17:52","119191.0","-4","2013-09-17T12:53:37","ZD111171","Texas","2005-01-01T00:00","78599","5.0"

The staff - friendly and accomodating - there is an exercise room free of charge - new bath producxts everyday - I love the Sofitel in New York. Its just big enough to meet your needs without being too big to be overwhelming - computer services in lobby and great bar and restaurant.","2013-09-17T11:46:05","111243.0","-1","2013-09-17T09:35:38","ZD111208","Washington","2007-01-01T00:00","98278","5.0"

I got two rooms via Hotels and made my choice based on (1) reviews from this site and (2) price. Knowing what I know now about the hotel I would make the same choice again.The location was good - right downtown near everything. The hotel lobby and rooms were clean. The staff was friendly. The area in which the hotel was located wasn't a bad or scary area. The rooms themselves were average in size (not tiny but not apartment sized). The bathrooms were small but adequate. We were on the 14th floor and had rooms on opposite sides of the hotel and each had views of the city.The subway station was only about 4-5 blocks away but it seemed farther when the temperatures dropped and the wind picked up. There is a Dunkin Donuts and Burrito Beach across one street and the Cambridge House restaurant across the other. One review on this site said great things about Cambridge House -- it's not bad if you don't want to walk too far and their service is really fast but the food really wasn't anything to brag about. Timothy O'Tooles (2 blocks away) had good food and drinks Rock Bottom Brewery wasn't too far away (near the subway actually) and they're pretty good too. Starbucks was also nearby.","2013-09-17T13:25:12","134414.0","3","2013-09-17T13:07:18","ZD111514","Washington","1975-01-01T00:00","98035","5.0"

We had found the hotel over the net but booked through a travel agent and requested a triple superior room. This was the only negative about the stay. When we arrived for our pre booked/paid for room our triple superior room was a room with 2 beds and a small cot. The cot was a disappointment as it was a single close to the floor and took up what ever available space was left in the room. Breakfast was good with variety room tended to be very warm. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Seating in the lobby and with the pub/lounge was nice with service extending onto the porch. Hotel was quiet clean and in a good area within close walking distance to tube stations Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. Hotel was always gracious about getting a cab/taxi as the door man often had to walk to the curb or down the street to fetch the taxi.

We booked 2 double-doubles and were pleasantly surprised having heard how small hotel rooms in NY can be. Our rooms were a good size with really comfortable beds TV microwave fridge iron and ironing board... in fact everything except a kettle! Luckily I'd brought a travel kettle as we Brits love our morning cuppa. The view from the rooms (of the railway tracks) was a bit disappointing but we weren't planning on looking out of the window much!The staff at the hotel were fantastic - nothing was too much trouble for them and any small needs were attended to immediately. Also the luggage store on our last day was a real boon - it meant we were able to enjoy our holiday right up to the last minute (and we did - arriving to pick up our bags 2 minutes before the shuttle bus collected us!).As others have said the deli next door was great for breakfast - but I must recommend the Westway deli on 9th avenue - near 43rd st. Even better value than the one next door and they do hot oatmeal which is brill when it's cold! Also unlimited coffee. A really substantial breakfast for 4 came to $27 including taxes. Fantastic.We ended up getting Citysights bus tour as they accosted us on the first day. Can't recommend them over Grayline as the frequency is much less. The guides were hilarious though!

This is a small hotel apartment style 36 rooms. We had a large 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment booked for $350/night. Room was clean well furnished hard wood floors and a fully stocked kitchen A/C.Typical NYC though it is noisy and bathrooms are small. Front desk staff on all days was very helpful and friendly and they split the bill up 4 ways so that we all can give our own method of payment. Apart from a couple small nuisances like the remotes not working toilet you had to hold the handle down wierd maintenance man (I think he used our bathroom when he was in there-GROSS) this hotel is a excellent value for the money as comparable 2 bedroom hotels would have been 500a night. It only has 36 rooms so it sells out fast. The location cannot be beat. Right in the heart of manhattan. You are right next to the W hotel and a really cool bar called the Whiskey Blue. Next door is the Waldorf Astoria. Rockerfeller Center 5th ave shops and beautiful St Patricks Cathedral are only a few minutes walk. The closest subway station is only a minutes walk at 51st and Lexington. Nice cafe downthe steet called Cafe Metro. A little pricey but food is good especially for a good hot breakfast.

While the weather wasn't great it wasn't the blistering cold weather that Montreal is accustomed to in these months. We checked in at about 2:00 and was given a room on the first floor. The room was large but felt cramped. There was a pull-out bed two fairly large twin beds two tvs sink microwave and refrigerator; amenities that the normal business traveler and most college students would prefer. We asked for a roll-away bed and got it several minutes later which at the time seemed great however maneuvering the actual bed to fit the confines of our room was quite a challenge; almost like a tetris game gone wrong.We stayed for 3 nights and while the stay wasn't bad it wasn't up to the expectations of my usual Marriott stays. While there was a free buffet breakfast the breakfast was way too early to catch and wasn't appetizing enough to want to get up for. Our room had a view; of the office building adjacent to us with the peering eyes of Montreal executives able to look into our room. The hotel is literally tucked away in a European-style alleyway and while it had it's charm and class I would've traded that away for a much more private yet sprawling suite.The location is great; at the end of St. Laurent 3-4 blocks away from the Place D'Armes metro stop and right in the middle of Old Montreal by the water. There's no need to drive around in the city as we walked to and from St. Laurent bars nightly and rode the Metro to places on St. Catherine by McGill.","2013-09-17T11:35:37","106206.0","-1","2013-09-17T11:30:51","ZD111392","Florida","1953-01-01T00:00","34615","5.0"

The two double-bedded rooms are located on the first floor front across the street from the office. The hotel rooms are divided by a street. Rooms were small and clean but the price couldn't be beat. No a/c but we slept comfortably with our window open. Always hot water for the shower. No amenities but remember this IS a budget hotel. It is an old motor lodge style hotel with parking available right in front of your door. A bit of a pine sol smell when you first open the door but it dissipates quickly. Management was wonderful very friendly and helpful let us store our luggage (the large heavy bags) in the office lobby our last day as we had a late night flight. They kept our smaller easy to grab and run bags behind the counter. Be warned that it is in a very noisy section of town located between busy-at-all-times-of-the-day-and-night Lombard St with lots of clubs the other direction. A firestation is located around the corner within steps of the hotel and receives calls all times of the night so bring your earplugs! Plenty of restaurants within two blocks. City bus routes within two blocks either direction. 6-8 blocks from Fort Mason Center and the Marina. A mile or more over hills to Fisherman's Wharf so unless you are in really good shape and love to walk take the 30 Stockton bus to Fisherman's Wharf you'll be there in about 10 minutes. Great place to stay if all you need is a warm shower and clean place to sleep.

The 3 bdrm was a perfect size for 5 people and contained 3 bathrooms a kitchen and washer/dryer.The staff at this hotel truly went above and beyond planning/booking all of our activities in Beijing: dinner reservations our Great Wall day trip and all Taxi rides. This was extremely helpful as there is very little English spoken in some parts of the city and quite frankly we were a bit intimidated. The Peking Duck at the restaurant recommended by the hotel (the one with the rainbow sign out front- that's all I can remember) was so good we went back 2 nights later.Upon check-in a hostess sat with us served us cappuccino and gave us information about the hotel and the city itself for 15-20 minutes. She even delivered a 24 case of bottled water to our room free of charge. The hot breakfast (included) was also enjoyable.The only knock on this hotel is the location; the area is quite dirty (in great contrast to the hotel itself) and there didn't seem to be many restaurants/shops in the immediate area. Taxis however are abundant and very inexpensive. Also there is a grocery store in the compound which is handy.Beware that the hotel is only part of a large complex of buildings (gated with tight security) and is very confusing to find even for taxi drivers. Make sure you are at the right spot before leaving the taxi.Overall the service at this hotel was outstanding. Also I am quite certain I will never stay in such an impressive suite again in my life. The rate when split among 5 people was more then reasonable. (approx. $50 CDN per night each). For what you are getting this is well worth it trust me. I would highly recommend this hotel.","2013-09-17T14:56:28","105273.0","2","2013-09-17T10:30:11","ZD111437","Georgia","1977-01-01T00:00","30542","5.0"

Very convenient with all our luggage. I wouldn't do it any other way. The room was spacious by NYC standards very clean and had 2 queen beds. The lobby was spacious and offered a concierge (which we never used) hot chocolate coffee tea and apples all day long/night. The buffet breakfast was good and plentiful and we didn't have an issue getting a table at all. The staff came around and offered us mints and asked if our stay was pleasant and if we had any concerns or complaints to please let them know so they could make it right. We paid $201.75USD/night plus NYC state taxes. The beds were comfortable lofty white duvets clean sheets every day. We met a couple from Dubai that were staying at Milford Plaza and they were very envious of our awesome hotel experience as theirs was terrible! I will definitely return to NYC and I will definitely stay at this hotel again. It's very close to Times Square Empire State TOTR Macy's Central Park and is in the heart of restaurant row.

The room was - well amazingly large by NYC standards- with a full kitchen to boot! We all loved the minimialistic Asian-Modern style decor and cool lighting as well as the pillow menu which included wedge pillows and- get this- magnetic pillows.The bathroom was on the small side but how much time do you spend in a bathroom? It was bright clean and well appointed.We paid $424.00 a night which might seem high but we would have needed 2 rooms at a non-suite hotel which would run $250 per room so I felt like we got a fairly good deal. The hotel staff were excellent. They responded quickly to requests and were always friendly and professional. They remembered our names and greeted us each time we entered or left the hotel.There were several places to eat nearby within 2 blocks which are reasonably priced. There is also a grocery store and wine store within 2 blocks. The subway is within very easy walking distance as well.The hotel is ideally located for a museum-based visit as it is close to MoMa the Met the Museum of Natural History and the Whitney.

We'll taken that up with our Travel Agent later. We were overheard in a deli discussing our options which were none and someone came to our rescue. They had just checked out of the Skyline and recommended it. We were only too happy to walk the 7 blocks to the Skyline. For $209 a night we got a room with a fridge 2 queen beds all the towels we needed etc we were quite pleased as you may be able to imagine.I was amazed at how clean our room was. Friendly staff great location and given our situation the price seemed great for us as we weren't expecting to find anything so quickly at the same rate we were planning on spending at the other hotel.The Amish Deli on 9th ave is the greatest place around. We went there for coffee and scones every morning $2.50 - you can't beat it. Great fruit lunch counter and all the other fabulous restaurants in the area we loved our stay and would return in a New York minute.","2013-09-17T14:25:13","100471.0","4","2013-09-17T13:08:25","ZD111616","Maryland","1994-01-01T00:00","20704","5.0"

I booked for 2 of us by checking the Expedia/Travelocity rates...then took advantage of Kimpton's website guarantee to match low rates and top with a free room upgrade. We got Jefferson King suites facing courtyard...each suite is 2 large high-ceilinged rooms with good-size bath and 6' tub. Tons of seating honor bar mini-fridge 2 TVs...amazingly comfy bed. Other 2 families in our group booked elsewhere for less square footage at twice the price.July heatwave but we had A/C (admittedly it struggled a bit for the 2 large rooms but not uncomfortable.) Hotel is older but has been updated with new carpet paint wallpaper and upholstery...spotless throughout.PERFECT location...you can walk to theatres Union Square Chinatown or Civic Ctr area...even Embarcadero. North Beach (uphill) is a little stretch but streetcars and cable cars are within a block or two for Fisherman's Wharf etc. Try Lefty O'Douls on Geary for a great hot breakfast under $7.Maids concierge desk clerk...even maintenance guy...all VERY friendly and just like family to us. Continental bkfst is $6.50 if you want the cereal/juice/pastries but coffee &amp; hot tea is free. Free wine and focaccia bread from 5-6pm...even book reviews onsite each Wednesday. EXCELLENT service...I would not think of staying elsewhere unless another Kimpton in the same area if this one is booked.","2013-09-17T14:11:04","143577.0","4","2013-09-17T09:55:41","ZD111387","Michigan","1993-01-01T00:00","49269","5.0"

Prices are starting to inch upward as expected now that it is more known but IMO still by far the best value for upscale luxory accomdations in Vegas. All the comments on this site about the rooms themselves are on the mark. Simply incredible. Think new luxory apartment w/ a view; don't think in terms of hotel rooms. Distance from strip has its pros/cons (as discussed in previous posts). To each is own but for us the pros far outweigh the cons. I see on trip Advisor that they received a couple negative reviews now. One related to overbooking. That sucks when that happens. I know hotels and airlines do that all the time. Unfortunately that risk exists at every hotel. Also saw a negative review about getting charged for evidence of smoking in the room. Obviously I have no idea if the Platinum was right in their accusation or not but I do know that The Platinum takes their no smoking policy extremely seriously. My advice would be not to stay here if there is any chance someone in your party may break down and try to smoke on the balcony or in the room. And even if you have cigarettes and don't intend to smoke them keep them out of sight in the room so cleaning people don't see them and get suspicious. I know this policy might be a turn off for some people. But to me I love how serious they are about this policy. Its one thing to be around smokers when out partying in a bar but that awful smell in hotels and houses from previous smokers is a HUGE turnoff.Having a Washer/Dryer in the room is a great convenience too. The unit-mart next door allows you to take advantage of having some food drink in the room handy.The bar exercise room spa and room service are all very good to excellent. Not cheap (other than the exercise room which is free) but nothing in Vegas is cheap. The cab situation is better than in early stays but still can be a wait at peak times. Not any longer than at the big places (like the Bellagio for example) but pschologically it may seem longer as there is not a line that is constantly moving like at places like that. But when all is said and done the wait is basically the same. During peak times i suggest ordering the cab through the bellman and then getting a drink in the bar and waiting there. The bellman will get you when it gets there. Just don't open a tab. Pay or your drinks when you get them and ask for glasses/cups you can take w/ you in case the cabs gets there real quick. The Bellman are FANTASTIC. Will do anything to help you out. Much better that the other larger places in town.One gripe I have is the price of Internet access. I am used to it being free. I can even expect paying a couple bucks but they really stick it to you here. I think it is $13/day or something. That really seems excessive to me. TIP: you can usally tap into some free wireless networks if you have a decent wirless router on you laptop. But overall still the place to stay in Vegas these days....","2013-09-17T12:59:58","140001.0","-2","2013-09-17T11:37:51","ZD111561","Minnesota","2000-01-01T00:00","55115","5.0"

I had never been to NYC before and didn't know where to stay so I picked the Wolcott for price and the reveiws from this site. I think the hotel is just fine yeah the elevator is too slow but the neighborhood (little korea) was neat and seemed safe enough to me. It was very convenient we never had to wait long for a taxi to come by. Actually I had never been in a taxi before this. Theres pretty decent coffee and muffins in the lobby every morning and a Starbucks and Dunkin Donut/Subway/Baskin Robbins just outside the hotel in case you need a little more variety. One block over on 32nd St. there's a few Korean rest. One has a buffett priced by the pound we didnt eat there but it was fun to look at all the different foods and stuff for sale. We didnt stay in the hotel much but when we were there it was friendly and so were the people on the streets. There is a highrise under construction across the street and we enjoyed listening to the workers in typical New York style fuss at the impatient drivers that were stuck honking their horns of course behind the taxis picking up and dropping off guests. We walked to Time Square and Macys everyday and the shops on 34th St. finding more shopping than I really wanted but the prices were very good and I did have a little room in my suitcase. So in all I think it was just fine a hotel for us.","2013-09-17T14:36:27","110110.0","1","2013-09-17T11:52:45","ZD111138","New York","1969-01-01T00:00","10471","5.0"

I agree with other reviewers that the 2 - 4 rooms would be a bit tight for 4 people but for 2 they were great.We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and the place was really quiet.Check-in was swift and as I'd requested we had been allocated 3 rooms on the top floor -(its quieter on the higher floors). Rooms were very modern functional clean and of minimalist design.The beds were comfortable - without being too soft - and all services worked without a hitch - (shower tv tea &amp; coffee making facilities).As a lot of people have already stated the location is excellent. Most tourist attractions are only a short walk / tube / bus / cab ride away and personally I was far happier staying in a very quiet part of town and travelling to somewhere with more action than staying in the busy West End.The breakfast in the morning was excellent. I've read another review where some of the food ran out by 9:30am but we didn't experience this and all the food and drinks we had were great and in good supply.Checking out was as straightforward as checking in and as we had been advised by the hotel we were parked in an NCP car park about 500 yards away in the Minories. We were heading out of London by 11am on the Sunday and the overnight parking only cost us •À_2 which I thought was amazing value.Overall I'd say if you want a cheap no nonsense hotel accommodation package in and around the City of London the Novotel Tower Bridge is an excellent choice. Definately book ahead of your visit though as we paid •À_52.50 per person including breakfast per night - which I thought was great value in Central London but the prices you are charged walking in off the street as listed as over 3 times as much.I'd definately be happy to stay there again at the weekend.","2013-09-17T11:46:58","144967.0","5","2013-09-17T10:30:32","ZD111388","North Dakota","1987-01-01T00:00","58436","5.0"

Absolute drunks flopping around at all hours of the day. You were lucky if they had clothes on. Seriously. Check-in was miserable. There were no lines. Only masses of people. Not too mention everything about my reservation was wrong. Wrong room wrong amount of beds wrong promotional code. I tried to argue about the promotional code b/c I was owed $25 in slot play $35 in food and 2 free drinks @ the pool. Lady behind the counter says I cannot have that that it is not the promotion I booked. I was prepared and pulled out my online reservation clearly stating my promotion and what it came with. Suddenly lady no speak English. I had things to do I didn't have time to argue with her. At least she gave me 2 free inner tube rentals that were almost the same value as the slot play. That was sweet. Never used them but thanks MGM for the reparations.The majority of the male drunks had one too many protein shakes and steroid injections. I wanted to tell some of them that when you work out you should probably include leg workouts as well but they will figure that out when those toothpicks snap under the tremendous weight of their HGH-infused upper bodies. For the rest of this post I will call them The Beef.The women drunks - don't get me wrong there were some cuties stumbling around this hotel but the majority were absolute trash with their chests hitting them in the chin. Many of these over 30women think that because they have these enormous plastic chests that it gives them the right to walk around the hotel in only their swim wear. And thongs. Flabby butts chunky thighs and cellulite galore. I nearly threw up at the tables numerous times. Pool area was nice but infested with the beef men and the skanks in high heels w/ too much makeup. I took a dip in the waterfall pool where nobody was because they didn't want to ruin their hair. The water was very nice crisp and refreshing! I then went around the lazy river where all The Beef brothers stood for hours at a time drinking and giving high-fives. The water felt 15 degrees warmer. And it was a lot less blue. I will not begin to speculate why. I will add that the restrooms at the pool area were very clean as if unused. That was nice.Best part of the hotel was the room. Many people complain about the West Wing. I thought they were awesome. Small yes but great use of space. Stand up shower was great. Water pressure was adjustable and a shower head on a chord to wash those hard to reach places. TV in the mirror is a great idea too. Also the bed was one of those Heavenly bedsets that I've had at Westin hotels before. Amazing. Best bed I've ever slept in.Went to the Trattoria restaurant. A little pricey but great. Got a table right next to the walkway from the pool to the casino area. Ate right around the time the pool closed and all the drunks were coming back. True hilarity at its best if you enjoy people-watching.Food court is good when looking for a cheap and quick eat. Especially after losing money at the tables. Dollar menu.I had already seen Ka on a previous trip. Flat-out awesome. Go see it. I've seen many Cirque shows including that overpriced water one at the Bellagio. This one was my favorite. Cut out a lot of the time-wasting lame clown comedy and had more incredible action. The stage is mind-blowing.By the way this hotel is BIG. It is not a Marco Polo trek like some make it out to be but it is more walking than any other hotel I've ever seen. The hallways go on for miles. And the elevator service is horrible. If you are on the fourth floor and trying to go down suck in your gut because it is a fight to squeeze into these overcrowded things. They probably need about 3 times as many elevators as they have.Overall the nice bed and cozy room save this from a 1 star rating. I'll give it 2. Would only stay again if I got an insane deal.

Not a glass and modern minimalistic boring place but one steeped in history and grandier that you don't find in many places today.When we arrived we were greeted with a very warm welcome from the receptionist who didn't take long to go through all the details of the booking. Our room was a bit small for a weeks stay but no problem we returned to reception to ask for a bigger room and although they couldn't do anything that day told us that after 3pm the following day they would have a superior room for us to view.After viewing the room we were very pleased indeed and took it straight away.We found all the hotel staff more than happy to answer any questions we askedThe room was cleaned every day and the bedding changed every other day and turned back every evening. Yes you do find that the hotel is very busy with business people but thats one of the things you have to put up with as these people and there companies are the ones that are probably keeping this hotel going.No we didn't find them intimatating as we also saw how pleased some of the were to be in such a lovely hotel and they to were taking photographs of the lobby and asking passing guests to take a photo of them in the hotel.Please except it as a pleasant experience as we did. How is wish we could go backAnn DaviesSwansea","2013-09-17T13:22:22","127745.0","1","2013-09-17T09:50:59","ZD111355","Oklahoma","1959-01-01T00:00","73737","5.0"

Hotel is in an excellent location just a couple of blocks from 5th avenue &amp; grand central station and as with most places in New York within access of taxis buses etcWe were upgraded to an executive room on arrival ( check in was easy although we did see long queues there during our stay) which was a good size with a huge bed like other people I agree that the bathrooms are very small but I'm not going to give a negative score for that because it didn't effect our holiday in anyway.We had breakfast there most mornings and found it to be comfortable &amp; relaxing the choice of food was huge and the coffee &amp; OJ was constantly filled all the staff we found were helpful &amp; friendly.The one negative was the external noise even on the 13th floor we heard everything outside including a particularly annoying cooling/heating unit which appeared to be located on the roof above reception the quality of the double glazing was poor and didnt really reflect the needs of a city centre hotel. Other then that everything was fine and we would stay at the Barclay again.","2013-09-17T14:01:49","122265.0","1","2013-09-17T11:13:40","ZD111156","Pennsylvania","2012-01-01T00:00","19401","5.0"

Shower water pressure. Comfortable bed.The hotel is under construction right now. Plastic covers the hallway carpeting. Everything is o-l-d. It smells old in the lobby etc. You get the picture.In the room the bed seemed to be the only fairly new piece of furniture. The two covered chairs were so worn it looked like they bought them from goodwill. Both chairs had dark grease spots from where people leaned their head against them. Dust lines the carpet against every wall. Wall paper was peeling on at least 3 different corners. There was a huge waterstain and crack in the ceiling in one corner of the room. Customer service is hit and miss. I honestly felt bad for the few employees who made an effort. What's the point if the front desk clerk is great and house keeping forgets to clean the room? They overlooked our room the second night and when I mentioned it that evening while asking for extra towels the response I got from the gal manning the desk that night was: 'and...?'The tv in the room is old. Channels are fuzzy. Audio levels spike everytime you change the channel.I am by no means a 5 star traveler. But I expect clean rooms and courteous customer service. In this case I would've gladly paid extra to stay at the Westin across the street. Least I wouldn't feel like I was staying in a rundown old folks home.","2013-09-17T13:28:02","140680.0","3","2013-09-17T10:55:14","ZD111256","Rhode Island","1970-01-01T00:00","2915","5.0"

I received a flyer for 2 free rooms. Upon check in we were granted a double queen bed non smoking room. We happened to be on the very top floor which wasn't a big deal at the time but got annoying waiting 10 minutes for the elevator everytime we wanted to get a beer from our room!! But like I said the room was free so it didn't bother me as much as it could have!! The Good:The check in clerk was very nice and the room was generally clean and the beds comfortable. The bath drained well and the shower had great water pressure. We did have a pretty nice view of the mountains to the west being up on the top floor. We were handed a coupon for 2 for 1 montery chicken sandwiches in the buffet/cafe while we were gambling. Great deal and the food was wonderful!! The VUE bar on the 2nd floor has a wonderful little porch overlooking the Fremont St. Experience.The Bad: The elevators are slow and shaky and we were always left wondering if they would break down while we were in them. The waitresses were non existant while we gambled and the main floor bartender was a crab. She actually told my wife they were out of Jack Daniels when she tried to order a drink. I went up and ordered one 20 minutes later and was served with a bitter look on her face. Why do they employ such people? The pool was closed for inspection when we checked in but opened a short time later. This is the coldest pool I have ever witnessed but it did make me forget about my hangover for a short time! It seemed everyone we had talked to in the elevators were losing including us. We like to gamble at other casinos Downtown anyhow so it was not a big deal to us! All in all we had a great time being Downtown. I don't think it matters too much to me which hotel we stay at as long as the price is right and free rooms always deserve a decent review. So we would definately stay here again expecially if the rooms are free!!","2013-09-17T12:42:26","104206.0","-2","2013-09-17T09:44:28","ZD111234","South Carolina","1973-01-01T00:00","29215","5.0"

We didnt have breakfast at the hotel as it was quite expensive and i find breakfasts at hotels are always the same crap. Be warned the car park is at the bank of the hotel we didnt know this before hand parked up a side street to go and check-in and find out where the car park was only to return to 2 traffic wardens putting a clamp on our car we were literally 5 mins max!

I cannot comment of the restaurants as we didn't use them however the Caxton Bar was nice but pricey.

While the weather wasn't great it wasn't the blistering cold weather that Montreal is accustomed to in these months. We checked in at about 2:00 and was given a room on the first floor. The room was large but felt cramped. There was a pull-out bed two fairly large twin beds two tvs sink microwave and refrigerator; amenities that the normal business traveler and most college students would prefer. We asked for a roll-away bed and got it several minutes later which at the time seemed great however maneuvering the actual bed to fit the confines of our room was quite a challenge; almost like a tetris game gone wrong.We stayed for 3 nights and while the stay wasn't bad it wasn't up to the expectations of my usual Marriott stays. While there was a free buffet breakfast the breakfast was way too early to catch and wasn't appetizing enough to want to get up for. Our room had a view; of the office building adjacent to us with the peering eyes of Montreal executives able to look into our room. The hotel is literally tucked away in a European-style alleyway and while it had it's charm and class I would've traded that away for a much more private yet sprawling suite.The location is great; at the end of St. Laurent 3-4 blocks away from the Place D'Armes metro stop and right in the middle of Old Montreal by the water. There's no need to drive around in the city as we walked to and from St. Laurent bars nightly and rode the Metro to places on St. Catherine by McGill.","2013-09-17T13:57:31","108096.0","-1","2013-09-17T12:02:05","ZD111367","Texas","1952-01-01T00:00","78577","5.0"

It felt and smelled like a Senior-Citizens Nursing home (no offense to anyone!). The room was old with outdated furniture...bathroom was tiny with the smallest sink I've ever seen.

Back to Hotel in time each evening (5.30 - 7.30pm) to sample Managers free drinks invitation. Excellent. Two good family type restaurants within the hotel and free use of a great Gym to guests. Good location for easy walking distance for trips to Statue of Liberty etc. Short 5 mins. walk past Ground Zero to discount designer store Century 21 which our daughters loved. Only two minuses - one being that the lovely River/skyline view is now obscured by the nearly completed construction of a new building. The other being that the Hotel is about as far downtown town as you can go before falling into the Hudson therefore it does take up some of your precious time to get anywhere. But it's nice to retreat to somewhere quiet. Would definately return to this hotel.","2013-09-17T11:26:04","124967.0","-5","2013-09-17T10:56:45","ZD111214","Arkansas","1981-01-01T00:00","71634","5.0"

Such a number of issues!! Sorry this is a long one... Firstly the reception staff. Despite the charming porter whom with we left a piece of luggage with earlier in the daycheck in staff were surly and brusque. Once we moved away from the desk to wait for the lift he went back to whatever was entertaining him on his computer screen with a colleague; perhaps he was annoyed we had interrupted?! Once upstairs we were shocked by the size of room •À_ it was SO small!!! Two people could not walk around the bed which was also small and uncomfortable (you could feel every metal spring) and was shoved into the corner of what MIGHT justify as a single-size room. One person sat at the desk meant the other had to climb over the bed or move into the shower room in order for the other to get the wardrobe or vice versa! Completely ridiculous and unacceptable for what we paid.The radiator sounded like a running tap on full and obviously needed bleeding. I immediately phoned down to reception to ask for another room but was firmly informed (before I could finish the question) that the Hotel was fully booked. No apology not even an apologetic tone. What about the radiator? No one was available and were told to try turning it off. With outside temperatures below freezing I didn•À_t think this was reasonable but was •À_reassured•À_ the rooms at the top of the Hotel stay warm regardless!! Too late to find anywhere else and it seemed clean enough (with the exception of a cocktail stick on the floor and hairs in the bathroom later discovered) so we resolved to stay and hoped a cup of tea might be a simple task....but this also let us down - the Kettle only worked when you held it firmly down on the base and had to remain doing so until it boiled. We gave up after one try. Lastly but by no means least offensive (and largely what drove me to writing this review) were the noisy pipes. I thought at first the noise I was being woken by at 4am was the neighbours in the bathroom as we had heard similar noises the night before. However I was proved wrong when EVERY SEVEN MINUTES thereafter the same noise erupted from above us. I can only compare it to as if they were being repeatedly hit with another piece of metal quite startling and the regularity lead me to believe it was the Hotel•À_s water or heating system rather than other guests. Despite all attempts even ear plugs did not work my partner and I crawled out of bed at 8am after being unable to sleep for 4 hours got ready and left exhausted without breakfast. We simply could not bear another minute at the hotel. I complained wearily at reception when checking out and was faced with the same absorption into a computer screen. No discussion no apology just that •À_yes sometimes the pipes can make some noise but no one else complained•À_. As if that was an acceptable response!! I couldn•À_t believe what I was hearing. I work within the hospitality and travel industry and never have I stayed anywhere so appalling or been dealt with so badly. All in all the most terrible stay and nonchalant response from the staff. Being so tired Sunday really tainted the weekend getting an early train home out of London. (the only good thing about this place is it's close to Paddington)To top it all off I am still waiting for an apology (the very minimum and at no point has this been offered).If you still decide to stay here please request a room before check in that you can walk around in and far from the noisy pipes!","2013-09-17T15:07:14","104035.0","3","2013-09-17T11:08:24","ZD111349","California","1984-01-01T00:00","90701","5.0"

We arrived mid-afternoon and we checked into both rooms within 5 minutes. The front desk clerk accomodated my request for rooms on a specific floor with a view and provided a refridgerator for medication at no charge. I could not ask for a smoother check-in process.The rooms at the Orleans are some of the largest standard rooms you will find in Las Vegas. Our rooms were extremely clean upon check-in and housekeeping did a great job during our stay.The Orleans leaves very little to be desired: great Video Poker bars low minimum table games lounges to watch your favorite sports excellent food options for all budgets and very helpful kind staff all around. There is a fairly large pool although this is not a hotel that offers a great pool scene...definately geared towards relaxation rather than parties. On-site bowling alley movie theater and food court.For those not familiar with Las Vegas this hotel is located ~1 mile off-Strip and is considered more of a local casino rather than a tourist destination when compared to the larger on-Strip properties. A rental car is helpful if you plan to stay at the Orleans and visit other areas of Las Vegas. The hotel runs a free shuttle to/from the Strip and the Gold Coast (a sister property just to the north) from 9:30 am to midnight daily. This is a great money-saving alternative to a cab ride. Hotel guests get priority.FYI: The Orleans charges a $5 per room per night Resort Fee that includes 10 minutes of Internet access in the business center among other things.","2013-09-17T14:49:04","110711.0","-5","2013-09-17T12:06:09","ZD111381","California","1978-01-01T00:00","92675","5.0"

This was our 3rd time in Vegas and we had always stayed at Excalibur in the SPA rooms (previously in Tower 2) this time when I booked the cost was $125.00 more then the previous year (2005/our first time same month). I was told that they had 2 Spa rooms one with a Widescreen TV (the one I booked) and one that had not yet been renovated ($35.00 cheaper per day). All seemed good until we got to the check in counter staff was rude. We were in Tower 1 this time so we thought it must be the tower that was renovated...wrong. The key did not work very well it took 5 trys before it let us in. We should have gone back down at that point but we were tired from the 6 hour drive to get there. When we walked in we noticed the TV was not the Widescreen SPA room we paid for. I went down to the check in clerk that helped us and told here this is not the room I paid for and was informed that there were no more SPA rooms available I asked to speak with the manager and was told he was unavailable. I could come back later to speak with him (she would not give me his name). I went back to the room and started to unpack and found I could only use 1 drawer in the dresser because the handles were broken off all but one...Had to keep most of our clothes in the suitcase. I went back to the check in counter (6 hours later- different girl - but just as rude) asked to speak with the manger was told again that he was unavailable. Informed this girl that we were not happy with our room and that I paid for the Widescreen SPA room she could not refund the difference or get us another room and I could come back tomorrow there were one of the widescreen SPA available then. I went down @ 1:30pm the next day to see if the manager was in yet or they could move us to the room we paid for (same girl from the first day) again no refund or room change. I tried everyday to get us the refund or speak with the manager. Did not happen once... I called the Excallibur booking desk when we got home and told my reservationist what had happened and she gave me the manager and general manger names with address and told me to wrote a letter. I did send a letter teling them of my dissappointment with my stay and even when so far as to make sure they knew I was not asking for any comp but just a call or note with an appology. NEVER HAPPENED. I did call back 2 weeks later and was told that they did recieve my letter but it was not their job to return calls or letters to patrons... Let me make this clear I had never once showed any anger or rudeness to either of the check in clerks. Don't stay here they don't care once they have your money and will not refund you even if they are in error ( I never got my refund of the room rate difference). Misersable stay.","2013-09-17T14:09:45","112424.0","4","2013-09-17T12:17:27","ZD111404","California","1964-01-01T00:00","92589","5.0"

This was a last minute decision so I had to book a hotel on arrival. London was very busy but I eventually got a room at the Charing Cross Hotel and was very impressed with this quality hotel. It kind of set hotel standards for me and I always remembered it as I stayed in hundreds of hotels in my business life thereafter.I have stayed in London many times since then but always had hotels booked for me. I arranged to go to see Jersey Boys(Wonderful Show) at the Prince Edward Theatre last weekend and decided to book in to the Charing Cross with my son. We got a great welcome from the reception girls who were very friendly and welcoming and they looked like they were enjoying their jobs. They offered a room upgrade for •À_20 and this was a very well appointed and spacious room with a great view of the London Eye. This hotel is in a great location in the exact centre of London with easy access to Theatreland and the West End. It has retained its feel of refinement and quality and the staff are the friendliest and most courteous I have ever encountered. The hotel is also very quiet and the beds are very comfortable.Breakfast is comprehensive and the food quality is very good and the restaurant staff are attentive.It was good to see that the hotel is still excellent after all these years and I will definitely use it on my next London visit.","2013-09-17T14:35:16","101079.0","-5","2013-09-17T09:19:34","ZD111177","California","1968-01-01T00:00","95609","5.0"

Though the people at uk.laterooms were very pleasant &amp; accomodating their website is misleading. Staunton's information there indicates a hairdryer satellite tv &amp; air conditioning in each room - we had none of these (5 tv channels). Staunton's own website advertises correctly so the fault may not be their's though they should have the other site fixed.We arrived about 9.30 in the morning well before check-in &amp; were offered their free full english breakfast while they hurried to prepare our room which I found gracious of them. The room itself seemed fresh &amp; was dust-free though needed vacuuming. The sheets were crisp &amp; clean though had holes in some places. The bathroom was spotless. Our window faced the street so was noisy but we were able to sleep. We could feel the springs of the large bed.There is no lift (none was advertised) and their stairs have a low pitch so climbing 2 floors got old. The carpets on the stairs need redone badly though they were clean.The breakfast was very good. The dining room is in the basement but plenty of light comes in from the windows where you see passers-by also a television so it was pleasant. The manager was nice enough to forward a message to us even though we weren't in our room &amp; hadn't stopped by the front desk. She wrote it down on the chance she'd find us in the breakfast room which she did &amp; we're grateful for that.The location can't be beat. A couple blocks from Goodge Street Station as well as numerous quick stop shopping (really helped us out to grab sandwiches from Boots or Tesco &amp; take back to the room); a few blocks more to Tottenham Court Road Station. A couple blocks from the British Museum &amp; Oxford Street is very close.We were going for value this time &amp; we got it for the most part which is quite the endeavor in this fabulous city. I would recommend Staunton for that aspect. However next time we'll spend more to get a bit more comfort and convenience.","2013-09-17T14:07:46","140692.0","5","2013-09-17T12:58:28","ZD111127","Connecticut","2017-01-01T00:00","6405","5.0"

It's a tiny bit tired and I'd guess the rooms are about 5 years away from refurbishment but with careless kids in tow that can be a blessing. The location is residential which is nice because the local shops and delis seem to cater for real people more than tourists. That said Grand Central Terminal is only a 10 minute walk away. The clean and comfortable suites really are enormous. We had a one bedroom with a sofa bed in the living room. The sofa bed was fine for the kids (8 &amp;11) but I guess it would be uncomfortable for a large adult. Our position at the front of the Hotel facing Lexington Avenue meant that there was some traffic noise. I used ear plugs nobody else was bothered by it. Being English I found the presence of a coffee percolator rather than a kettle disturbing. It could only manage one cup of tea at a time!

The continental breakfast which was included in our package was awful. The only fruit was tinned grapefruit or tinned orange segments. There was no fresh fruit. The choice of cereals was limited - just bran flakes cornflakes and one other type of flakes. Selection of bread was awful and stale. Only juices were orange juice or apple juice. Second morning we brought down our own food and used just the hotel's milk. (Note - I would not be a fussy eater either.)Other thing that was really annoying was that when we arrived we only had a one night booking as opposed to the 2 nights I thought we had - my fault not the hotels and so I booked the next night through the website I had used as was much cheaper than the hotels' price of •À_125 (without breakfast). Took 3 trips to reception that day and next before reservation was confirmed even with hotel voucher. And when we arrived back to hotel on 2nd night room cards did not work and had to go down to reception again!

The house was completely full but service was --for all things-- completely above par. This hotel has the fastest staff I have ever seen-- just ask and it's there everything from room service to valet to housekeeping requests. This staff is efficient unobtrusive and seems to be really concerned for guest comfort. They are professional without being cold/ aloof/ haughty (unlike at some hotels I could name). I received a great rate b/c I am a state gov't employee-- most hotels will give a special rate but this was definitely the best deal in the best location.  We had a late check-in arriving the night before the Pride parade and for some reason my request for a non-smoking room was not noticed/ held. I was skeptical of the ionizer they offered but gave it a try as the house was packed; there were no other rooms. (We were upgraded to a Nikko Floor room; a regular room became available by 8:00 the next morning but we opted to stay upstairs-- it was fine. I am a vehement non/ ex-smoker-- I notice ANY smoke smell &amp; it was clean-smelling when we came back to our room after a day in the city. Also I couldn't smell any smoke in the hallway from other rooms on the same floor. That kind of stuff is very important to me.)  I mention that it was Pride weekend b/c EVERY hotel was near-full &amp; going mad trying to keep up with all the guests/ tourists but NikkoSF was this calm island in the middle of the city. It's not a velvet -&amp;-brocade Victorian-furniture kind of place so if that's what you want look elsewhere. I hate frou-frou but like conveniences and style (ok can't afford 5 nights at the W)-- the Nikko was great. No upturned noses at our kids either even tho' we didn't see any other kids in the place til almost the last day.  We used the minibar for its fridge (not the snax)-- they didn't even check the minibar just took my word for it that we only rearranged things. Did get a regular rollaway fridge the 2nd day-- there are 2 Walgreen's within walking distance &amp; a 2-liter soda is still half the price of the minibar can of coke. The pool was closed for maintenance (a plumbing leak the day before we arrived) but the jacuzzi sauna &amp; exercise room were great. I could make a big deal out of this but I know stuff happens-- they apparently had already ordered the new pool liner so they were quick to take care of it.  Good art in the building (it matters believe me). Not overdone (see: Donatello or Triton &amp; otehr kitsch hotels). Double beds were small (we're used to a Cal King) but there seems to be not much else available unless you want to get a separate room for the kids. They were comfortable w/ quality linens. (Ask for yukata robes-- you'll feel silly walking around in them but who cares? You can get plush terry anywhere!) You cannot beat the location-- within walking distance of everything except the ferry to Alcatraz (no other reason to go to the wharf -except- the ride to Alcatraz). Theaters &amp; galleries as well as SFMoma close by-- go to the day-of-show booth (Union Square) to see what's offered. I will definitely stay here again for many reasons and am recommending the hotel to anyone I know who is staying in SF.","2013-09-17T13:35:13","144428.0","-4","2013-09-17T12:24:57","ZD111242","Michigan","1996-01-01T00:00","48225","5.0"

We had driven from Los Angeles in a hire car so it was no problem for us to be off the strip. Coming over the hill and seeing Las Vegas was GrEaT! We all screamed with delight lol.Our 2 bedroom apartment overlooked the carpark but were not fussy and the apartment was gorgeous so it made up for it. There were 2 bedrooms (doubles) 1 with en-suite and my brother slept on a fold out sofa in the living room. The closet in the master bedroom was HUGE. It was like a separate room! It was very quiet (im assuming because of it being October) and there were times when it was just us 5 in the pool area. The pool is lovely however at this time it wasnt heated - but like i said were not fussy and infact it turned into a game of who could stand it the longest! The kitchen was a decent size. 1 night our hungry english bellies got the better of us and we went and found a dominos pizza - mainly to see if it was better than the english ones (it wasnt lol). At the top of the road was a supermarket chemist and a place to develop photos. As it was 2 yrs ago i cant really remember how long it would take to drive to the strip and park in one of the hotels but i would say it was no more than 10 to 15mins. The strip was absolutly amazing and it was like a magical place! Having fun in the hotels that we had drooled over in the brochures was an unforgettable experience.My favourite hotel was the mirage with the white tigers dolphins and lions. It was absoltutly unbelieavble!! The Aladdin was just a DREAM for shopping.For those on a budget Sunterra is a brilliant idea. I would defo go back although not until im 21 so i can enjoy a drink and a spot of gambling! lol. If i won the lottery i would probably stay in the hotels but the Sunterra was lovely and i cannot fault it in anyway. Oh and looking towards the strip from the Sunterra and seeing the light from the luxor shoot into the sky was great! ;)","2013-09-17T11:41:35","119339.0","-2","2013-09-17T13:03:49","ZD111321","Minnesota","1982-01-01T00:00","55488","5.0"

Firstly just don't go there july and august when it is so hot and humid (not sunbathing weather without losing a stone in weight in half and hour!) We had 3 nights at the end of a weeks holiday in the Maldives. Absolutely gorgeous hotel at the Residence and Spa. Had a Prestige room. Extremely spacious and immaculate. Massive bathrooms and lots of Molton Brown bath goodies. View of gardens on the ground floor and lots of tropical little birds everywhere which was nice. 1 minute walk to the lovely pool which was a must every 10 mins or so whilst sitting around the pool for 2hrs each afternoon! Service as expected-7star!!! Food in the Dining Room was out of this world. Lovely portions so could easily have 3 courses without feeling like keeling over! Service in there was excellent. Gorgeous room with very high ceilings. Breakfast was taken in here every morning too and the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon was absolutely perfect. The manager of the Residence &amp; spa even came over to apologise he was away the previous 2 days and was the most polite frenchman i have ever had the pleasure in meeting. The only mistake was going to the gold/spice souk at midday nearly passed out getting out of the airconditioned taxi!! Couldnt breathe. Being in the gardens was lovely as didnt have a view of 'The Palm' and all the construction on this man made island. It doesnt look very impressive at the moment. No one was on the beach maybe due to heat but due to view aswell. Around the pool and gardens you can hardly hear any construction going on. Dont get me started with that! There is just so much of that in Dubai its ridiculous. I dont think it will ever stop. My overall impression of 3 nights in Dubai that i was so excited about originally was 4/10. Gutted with most of it but can also see all the positives be it in the future. I heard that 1/3rd of all cranes around the world are in Dubai so yes you can almost see that sadly! The hotel had no faults whatsoever so i give the hotel 10/10!. It was much smaller than The palace and the Arabian Court and felt much more intimate. We did eat at Tagine (moroccan) restaurant at The Palace on the last night and have to say we enjoyed that immensly. The wine selection at The Dining Room and Tagine was incredible if you are into some classics and a good vintage.Shopping at the Emirates Mall was great and to watch the skiing at the indoor skislope was a laugh. You needed to stay inside a mall pretty much all afternoon with the heat etc but it was immaculate. Wish the malls in london were like that!! Lastly wish we were there October time when i hear they have blue skies and sunshine and not dust humidity and constant heat and haze. So hope to persuade the other half to go back sometime but he just didnt take to Dubai whatsoever.","2013-09-17T15:01:12","116987.0","3","2013-09-17T10:46:24","ZD111282","Missouri","1949-01-01T00:00","65270","5.0"

My partner and I have just recently returned from our third stay at 41 encompassing nine brilliant and warm days in April and what we found wonderful about 41 on previous visits is still wonderful and that a few improvements have been made as well.What is still wonderful is that after a day in London absorbing all the sights sounds (and moisture) of a vibrant capital the calm of 41•À_s Executive Lounge is where you can put your day into perspective. It really is a retreat in a busy world and nowhere do I feel the need for a quiet spot than in London. As always the staff has learned your name (which seems to happen always whether you stay one night or several) the greeting is warm and the service impeccable. It is a wonderful place to quietly unwind at the end of the day.New since my last visit the English Breakfast is now included in the room rate and the •À_Plunder the Pantry•À_ program in effect from 20:30 onwards now offers more variation in its salads and cold meats from night to night. One evening there was some beautiful parma ham the next some very good p•À_t•À_. Green salads alternated with a cucumber or beet salad and fresh bread was always available. What brings me back to 41 is the feeling of genuine welcome I experience when I walk through the door from the incomparable resident manager Chantal to the entire staff. It is rare to find true hospitality in the hospitality industry but 41 has made it into a comfortable art.","2013-09-17T12:42:31","143301.0","-1","2013-09-17T10:25:38","ZD111462","Nevada","2012-01-01T00:00","89138","5.0"

I hope the following info helps - go for Vienna Tours for your desert safari tour (140dirhams) its a bit more cheaper and we didnt have any issues at all. For our dhow cruise (160dirhams) we went with 4 Star and again - no issues. Of course do go to the Mall of Emirates Ibn Battuta Mall Gold Souk Burj Dubai Dubai Creek Wild Wadi Park.

Smooth check-in very nice welcome. Our room was on 2nd floor and overlooked an interior courtyard - so very quiet. The room was spacious and the beds were fantastic! Lots of pillows - high quality. The a/c was an older system and a bit loud coming on/off. Bathroom could use towel rails and fan and the new sinks really didn't have the best drainage. Loved the citrus-lavender toiletries. Also appreciated the single cup Starbucks coffee in-room. We didn't use the internet service. Reception people and porters were extremely pleasant and accommodating - always welcoming back from our day and asking if they could help us plan our morning. We consulted the concierge one evening and found this man a tad short and unaccommodating - not at all representative of the majority of staff. We ate at Knuckles one evening; average sports bar - nothing to write home about. The hotel was a great location for our wknd. It was far enough away from the main tourist route and smell of the wharf area. There is a great cafe across the street Hollywood Cafe for bkfst. Super Sightseeing is also on the corner - excellent. On the other side of the hotel Cost Plus World Market where one can buy cheap wine cheese and take back to your room.

The single room is very small - but with so much living space it really wasn't a problem. Yes the decor is a little tired but everything was spotlessly clean and you cannot beat the location if your looking for easy access to mid town sights.

In a great neighborhood. There is a full size grocery store a short cable car ride away on Cailifornia Street. We had 2 beds in the room a couch a dining area with table and chairs. The small kitchen was spotless with all dishes and appliances needed. There was a light breakfast offered the bagels were very good. The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful.

I would struggle to give it 2 stars!!! Upon arrival it appeared a nice quiet hotel. I pre booked a double room which I presumed would be a double bed and fairly spacious. How wrong I was! The room had 2 single beds and was very small with hardly no room to walk around! The TV didn't work and in the 'tiny' en suit bathroom a glass on the side had dirty tooth paste dried on to the bottom. The shower was dirty with the previous guests hair still present!! Upon raising my concerns to the receptionist she began to argue with me telling me that it was impossible that this could happen. I was told by the manager that I should've made them aware as soon as I found the faults. I explained that I had only arrived 20 minutes prior. The receptionist argued that I had booked in at least 2 hours and insinuated that the issues were caused by my usage. I asked her to check what time I checked in after a few minutes telling me that it was at least 2 hours she checked and then realised that it had been 40minutes. She then argued that it wasn't 20minutes like I stated. I found her mannerisms and attitude totally unnacceptable. They did however sort out the TV and glass but failed to remove the hair left from the previous guest. The buffet breakfast would be excellent choice if you like toast cereal cheese ham and cold hard boiled eggs. Oh and you can wash it down with orange squash!!!! The breakfast was pitifull!! I had to go else where when I checked out! Overall the hotel was in a good location but that was about the only positive thing I could find. My advice to anyone wanting to book this hotel DON'T.

Our kingsize bed was so comfy we had no trouble falling asleep at night. The lighting was state of the art which took a bit to figure out but once figured out it was lovely. There was even a brass switch on the wall above the night table that when turned on lit a small light outside our room that stated we did not want to be disturbed. There was also the traditional do not disturb sign (wooden)as well that you hung on the door. The room was beautifully furnished and had a wardrobe with a programmable safe in it. The air conditioning worked great as well. The only thing I could say that I wasn't fond of the electronic system. I am not an electronic buff and it took some figuring out to get TV music dvd player computer internet (wireless keyboard) etc to work. The bathroom was truly gorgeous and spotless. We had a huge soaking tub with a shower plus an additional shower with a huge showerhead a large vanity and a towel warmer. There was always plenty of hot water and an endless supply wonderful toiletries which the staff had meticulously placed on the shelf. The linens were exceptional. Large thick white towels with a black 41 monogram on some of them. Two kinds of bathrobes terry and waffle. The staff were wonderful and very professional. Chantal the Resident Manager is a perfectionist and this carries over to her staff. The staff in the executive lounge where we had breakfast each morning were so meticulous (but very friendly) even your plates were placed so that the 41 logo was at the top. Nothing dared to be out of place. The turn down service was a nice touch with a candle being lit in the bathroom each night as well as slippers and robes being layed out for you. 41 is located less than 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace Victoria Rail and Tube Station and across the road from the Royal Mews. Yes the Queen is your neighbor!  I could go on and on about 41!! 41 has spoiled us for life!!","2013-09-17T14:18:38","147501.0","-3","2013-09-17T11:49:17","ZD111154","South Carolina","2003-01-01T00:00","29623","5.0"

Once you master the subway it is far cheaper than the taxi option when you are likely to be at Central Park and Soho etc in the same day!One tip - avoid the offer of a bus to the airport and rely on a taxi - at least the taxi will not have additional stops en route to JFK!","2013-09-17T12:20:14","100448.0","-3","2013-09-17T12:20:01","ZD111289","South Carolina","1950-01-01T00:00","29405","5.0"

Most of the doubles are quite spacious the singles just adequate. Showers no baths. Cleanliness is OK. Their housekeeping is a bit haphazard - not killer problems but stirring your tea with your biro is a bit annoying and jamming curtain rails rather more so.Lots of stairs so it might not suit the less mobile but plenty on offer on lower floors.Definitely a cut above most small lower-cost hotels in this sort of area and with direct tube connections into the city centre.","2013-09-17T13:15:47","101324.0","-2","2013-09-17T12:45:29","ZD111496","Texas","1953-01-01T00:00","75245","5.0"

None of us knew what to expect all that mattered was memories were to be had and a great time doing so. We arrived very late in the evening with no shuttle or check in problems. Our 12th floor room was located near the elevator and was clean and cool and surprisingly very quiet. The bed was comfortable and we always had clean towels. The Impersonators on the casino floor were a hoot and access to the rooms is easily loacted from the Casino front entrance. Yes we had issues with ice the entire place is outdated and the elavators worked 1/2 the time but if your plans are to actually enjoy LV then none of this should matter. There is no better location than HERE unless you are at the hotels across from or beside the Imperial. Shops eateries casinos all easily accessible. I would highly suggest to first get a $15 3 day pass on the Deuce double decker bus and you can get on and off the strip and downtown it runs 24hrs. OR walk. I would probably stay here again knowing that I would be just as busy as I was this trip. The beds were very comfortable the room was cool the price was right and that's all I required on this trip.

The best of Vegas in all considerations. This property is located off the strip but our rental car took care of this and allowed for side trips during our stay. We found the Red Rock very clean ready when we arrived with a duly attentive and courteous staff at the ready. The casino was managable in it's size and scope with a layout that took only a little getting used to. Gambling staff was forgiving and even helpful to those of us who don't live at the blackjack tables. So much so that we even managed to take a little bit of their profits home with us. The hotel was quiet and just far away enough from the late nite crowd. The pool was fabulous. One could have a drink smoke a cigar play blackjack in a bathing suit all the while working on your tan and people watching.

The hotel is entirely set on the 5th Floor of 41 Buckingham Palace Road ( it used to be the grand ballroom for the Ruebens next door).Everthing is based around the Excecutive Lounge which has the feeling of and Gentlemans Club. Breakfast is served as well as evening drinks and if you are feeling peckish at any time you can 'raid the pantry'.We had a split level suite which had a small seeting area downstairs with a desk chairs and a flat screen TV. This area was overlooked by a small gallery which was the bedroom. The bed was hugely comfortable. There was another flat screen TV in the bedroom.The bathroom was very large. A very good size walk in shower with very good pressure. The jacuzzi bath was wonderfull. Very long wide deep and another flat screen TV to watch while you soaked.Staff are attentive but not intrusive making the effort to remember names. We had a 'Romantic' Turn Down Service which consisted of a heart made from rose petals on the bed as well as two roses bottled water and the next days weather forecast. Also canpes are offered in your room early evening which was a very nice touch.The only fault we had was at breakfast. I had to ask for an English breakfast (rather than being asked for an order) and when it arrived it was pretty much stone cold. They staff were of course extremely apologetic and immediately offered a fresh replacement.Overall this is a superb choice if you want that personal touch in intermit surroundings.","2013-09-17T14:45:37","104691.0","2","2013-09-17T13:01:57","ZD111132","Virginia","1976-01-01T00:00","22022","5.0"

We booked our hotel stay with Sheraton directly and reserved with a credit card for guaranteed late arrival. We are also Starwood Preferred Guest members. We arrived at the Sheraton at 9:55pm after driving for 14hours. The Sheraton was completely sold out but supposedly had one room left but wasn't sure if it was clean and ready for our stay. I waited for over 45 minutes (with screaming 3 year old twins driving my husband crazy) waiting for the Sheraton staff to (1) find a room and (2) see if it was cleaned. I was told that they had one n/s double room left because another guest had changed their mind at the last minute. This made me wonder why the last minute room change. Finally after 45 minutes we arrived at our room (218) which was a handicapped room. Although the room was very large there was a big wet spot by the window (could be why the previous occupant changed rooms) that has yet to dry. Also the carpet was filthy with pink stains under the desk and other stains throughout the room. The shower had little pressure so it took a long time to wash your hair. The lamp knob was broken so you had to borrow the other lamp knob to turn the broken lamp on. We had to ask for an ice bucket because ours was missing upon check-in. The room a/c was weak and it was quite humid in our room. We had a view of the dumpster and the employees smoking lounge/picnic area directly outside our window. Needless to say we kept the curtains drawn. Another word to the wise the Sheraton's all cater to pets so be prepared for pet nuisance(s) stained carpet etc. I can't say I could recommend this hotel to others based on the overall condition of our room. I heard another couple while waiting to check in that they paid extra for club level room because they were supposed to get cocktails and continental breakfast. Neither were available so the front desk clerk compted them for a buffet breakfast which would have normally cost $12.00 per person. My husband and kids loved the waterpark. The only downfall was that it was a holiday weekend and packed with kids.

I travel as a consultant to non-profits and my clients understandably want to keep hotel expenses reasonable which 6 Columbus's rates do accomplish. I am content with a hotel that falls far short of luxury but 6 Columbus did not meet basic needs. The rooms are small including suites which surprisingly are not really suites but rather single rooms like all others. My room reminded me of a college dorm room. It had no closet but did have a small armoire regrettably not deep enough to hold a clothes hanger back to front and wide enough to hold very few shirts or suits. Inquiring at the front desk I was alerted that two cupboards were built into one side of the base of the bed which I had not seen since a duvet hung over them. This helped but it meant I had to get on my knees to retrieve anything. I was a single traveler; I cannot imagine how more than one person could negotiate this room. Of course the hotel finds plenty of space for its in-room mini-bar food and souvenir concessions. That duvet by the way was not clean (showing organic remnants of a previous guest) and was finally laundered or replaced on the fourth day despite my earlier requests. The duvet is the only bed-covering: there's no sheet so you sleep under the duvet (which for me became unbearably hot) or nothing. I soon realized this was not such a bad thing. Because the noise level is high (especially from staff in the hallways--and I was not even near the elevator) the only effective strategy is to turn the AC way down so it runs as much as possible to drown out the noise at night and then it's so cold in the room that the duvet is perfect. A large roach or water-bug ground into the carpet remained for several days after my arrival (and impossible to miss) until I forced the cleaning person to deal with it as I stood by and watched. The cleaning staff was invariably pleasant; one day however I returned to the room at 5 in the afternoon to find them just starting on my room which was inconvenient. The room telephone received calls but I could not dial out or retrieve messages that were left (though they announced their presence through the blinking light). A manager came to the room to try to fix it and confessed that the hotel's whole phone system was a total mess. In two weeks the phone was never fixed. One night I called the front desk via my cell phone to arrange an early wake-up call the next morning and the call arrived as requested. The next morning after that someone from the staff banged on my door at the same early hour shouting that this was my wake-up call but my phone wasn't working. (Unfortunately that was to have been my sleep-in day.) Room was quite dark even with all the lights on full as the window gave on to a deep air-shaft that let in little light. Bathroom was to the usual small-hotel standard. Hallways are very narrow and are made more difficult to navigate by room-service trays which spend entire days without being collected. Sometimes these sit in stairwells which must surely be a safety violation. The in-room information book says they deliver the NY Times every morning but instead they delivered the NY Post an entirely different species of newspaper. I pointed this out at the front desk and although the staff-person seemed not to grasp what I was saying they did deliver the Times (along with the Post) the next day and most days thereafter. Front-desk staff was generally cold and unhelpful. Concierge was pleasant and doormen were eager and cheerful. Entry hallway leading from lobby to elevators is kept very dark (sexy and mysterious I guess) but I found it impossible to see when entering from the brightness of the street (often via a small homeless encampment outside) and guests were forever colliding with each other in that dark hallway. 6 Columbus cultivates a chic and high-attitude veneer but does not address the essentials of what a hotel must minimally provide. Internet is $10 per day; I might expect a hotel that tries to trade in trendiness would offer it for free as so many now do. They do respond somewhat to nudging. Still for a two-week stay it grew depressing and I cannot recommend this hotel.","2013-09-17T12:28:24","154727.0","0","2013-09-17T10:44:45","ZD111613","California","2018-01-01T00:00","95835","5.0"

However when I stayed there in December one thing amazed me...for three of my four nights in the hotel the bar was closed to residents as it had been hired out for private parties. If you wanted a drink you either had to sit in the lobby or the tiny bar of the restaurant downstairs.Completing the whole Thompson experience are the beautiful Thom bar and A60...clearly this was an experience that i did not get. When you are paying the best part of $700 per night you want to be able to drink in the bar. To be told that it is owned by a seperate company is pathetic...if you dont control it take it off your website. To add insult to injury they sent a bottle of average champagne to my room...of course in Soho that is exactly where you want to drink...in a room on your own!!!!In synopsis what a crap experience for your guests...worst of all there was no warning and when friends joined me for a drink i looked like a tit in that i could not drink in my own hotel.","2013-09-17T14:04:41","142033.0","-5","2013-09-17T12:17:13","ZD111182","Colorado","2015-01-01T00:00","80466","5.0"

We had a 2 bedroom located on the 9th floor. The resort was a pleasant surprise! Check-in was smooth and directions to the resort were clear and precise. Only drawback was the need for additional help at the front desk. The rooms were huge and both were equipped with full kitchens. This was a novelty since most resorts that offer and A and B unit usually offer a mini kitchen in the other unit. One noticeable drawback was the lack of a balcony to sit out on and enjoy coffee in the mornings enjoying the mountain views. The pool area was nice but with the strong winds in the afternoon umbrellas became quite unstable. The pool was quite cool; even though air temperature in the upper nineties. A car is definitely a must since you are located approximately six to seven miles from the strip although the resort did offer transportation to and from the strip. One caveat if you utilize this transportation is that seating is limited on bus and first and last boarding came be filled over capacity. There is a grocery store about a mile north of the resort and food prices are decent. The resort did a good job at scheduling tours and events on and off the strip but due to the lack of help gives you time if crowds are large. The South Coast Casino next door is open and new. It sports a large bowling alley and a fairly open casino that wasn•À_t overly crowded and smoky even during peak weekend hours. I would definitely recommend this resort to others and will visit again myself.","2013-09-17T11:43:31","148874.0","-1","2013-09-17T09:58:30","ZD111269","Florida","1964-01-01T00:00","33359","5.0"

As a result the general feel around the hotel was quiet. The main foyer / bar area is very impressive however the bar was not 'open' beyond the Director's Cocktail Reception in the evening (5:00PM to 7:00PM) which was unfortunate given the high ceilings and funky chandelier lighting. It is quite the space.Rooms were very •À_Bombay•À_ style •À_ which is not my taste and the bathroom was a good size with black and white •À_art deco•À_ feel to it.

Only point to note for future is the ice machines are located on the 3rd and 4th floors. By chance when we were riding the elevator it stopped on the 4th floor and there it was the ice machine sitting directly outside the doors of room number 404 and 405.

It exceeds all basic requirements more than a 3 star hotel. Nothing was too much for the extremely friendly staff and true to Dubai style everything was dirt cheap inside and outside of the hotel. The only thing we found remotely expensive but worth it was the water park which was your typical theme park prices in an amazing area. The beaches and the zoo ranged from 20p-•À_1 per person. In a great area although is some distance from the main tourist attractions which isn't important as to be dropped off and picked up anywhere is about •À_4 so we had our own personal chauffer most days for about •À_4 a day! There is a very delicious pizzeria in the lobby which you can ring directly and have delivered and is about 50p for a 10 inch pizza! Unfortunately most people don't but we tipped very generously here and it goes along way and you can see the gratitude from the underpaid staff. Next door to the supermarket and surrounded by resturants. Although it is difficult to find alcohol in Dubai we were about a 5 minute walk from the nearest bar an english sports bar with english prices. Pool area was lovely with a lovely view from the rooftop pool. and rooms were comfortable spotless and reasonably sized with a lovely bathroom. The only negative to our holiday was that we stayed in the height of summer in Auguest and the weather was at times unbearable but the rooms were air conditioned as were most places. We were reccomended to travel during our winter to get the most out of the experience. We booked some lovely trips through our hotel and the dubai creek cruise was a lovely evening.

The room was fine - plain decoration two comfy beds just right for resting our weary legs after a lond day sightseeing and a neat little bathroom with all you needed of and a nice big TV!Where the floors are wooden it was a bit echoey which did wake me up a few times on the first night as you could here people walking around and slamming doors! I learnt my lesson and wore earplugs the next night (from the airplane) and slept perfectly!It was nearly a little shop so we could buy bottles of water etc just round the corner there was a lovely coffee shop and the subway was just a block away. Very convenient!After checking out Victor arranged for our luggage to be locked in a luggage room was was also very convenient as our flight wasnt until the evening and we wanted to do some more sightseeing!This hotel is not as bad as other reviews made.

Ideal if you want a walk home after the huge American portions of food.Rooms are a little dark and the air conditioner slightly noisy but other than that they were great. Two huge double beds and a large sofa bed which we requested. Small kitchen area with a hob and fridge.

You enter a small courtyard through a private gated entrance. There are three buildings. We were lead into the center one containing a small reception area and shown a 'library' where you take meals/tea. We were then escorted to the front building to our rooms. The entrances are ordinary rather than luxurious and the elevator is very slow. We had a two bedroom suite which was actually a one bedroom suite interconnecting to a junior suite. The junior suite is brilliant.. a small sitting area and tiny kitchen separated from a king-bedded room by glass doors. The color scheme is attractive.. the kitchen quite impressive.. but the rooms need more light the contemporary furniture is uncomfortable and the magnificent bath is quite chilly. The one bedroom suite has a large well equipped kitchen complete with a washer-dryer and the hotel provided complimentary cereal milk bottled water etc. Unfortunately the living area is too small (half the size of the kitchen) and again the contemporary furniture is uncomfortable. The beds are comfortable with nice linen and there is plenty of closet space. While the rooms had their pros and cons the hotel staff is wonderful. From the moment we made our reservations the concierge was offering us assistance. Everyone is very kind and very attentive. Our rate through Virtuoso included breakfast and we chose to eat in the 'library'. The staff was fantastic.. handling our every request.. I simply cannot say enough about how good the service was at this hotel. The hotel is also very private. Each floor contains 4-5 suites.. we rarely ran into people except in the library. Some 'celebrities' were staying in the hotel and they were treated graciously without fuss or fanfare dining among us like 'ordinary people'. So here's how I would boil it down:Location is good.. close to Buckingham Palace.. although very quiet. Covent Garden is the current happening spot where you'll find people walking about at all hours. Westminister is very quiet in the evening but quite convenient.The facility: the hotel is very nice. It is contemporary not traditional so if you're looking for 'old' London.. this is not it. Nor is this not a hip hotel. Nothing boutique about it. You get something more like a luxury apartment.. very nice space and a kitchen for your money. While 51 doesn't have a bar you can walk into Crowne Plaza for its bar and its restaurants too.The service: exceptional. Truly exceptional. One other observation: this is a great location for families because of the apartment style living. The staff is very kind to children... has a free DVD library for them to sort through...and handled the kids who turned up at meals very well. Value: London is terribly expensive right now. We paid nearly gbp500 a night (around $850 a night). Yes we found that a bit pricey. We were offered a two bedroom suite at the Baglioni (chic luxury) for gbp430 the Durley (traditional) gbp270 the Langham (traditional) gbp400 the Landmark (traditional luxury) gbp525 and the Soho (boutique luxury) gbp725 to give you a comparison. In hindsight we might have opted for less expensive alternative (Durley or Baglioni) given how little time we spent in our rooms.Good luck with your travel plans!","2013-09-17T13:48:25","152651.0","-1","2013-09-17T12:06:28","ZD111557","Kansas","2009-01-01T00:00","66431","5.0"

Booked this hotel based on the recommendation of an industry expert in the boutique hotel field. Hotel was very nice comfortable and the staff were extremely friendly. Icing on the cake...concierge brought car back from valet parking on Sunday and it had been washed•À_it was sparkling!The hotel is small with approx 45 rooms. As a result the general feel around the hotel was quiet. The main foyer / bar area is very impressive however the bar was not 'open' beyond the Director's Cocktail Reception in the evening (5:00PM to 7:00PM) which was unfortunate given the high ceilings and funky chandelier lighting. It is quite the space.Rooms were very •À_Bombay•À_ style •À_ which is not my taste and the bathroom was a good size with black and white •À_art deco•À_ feel to it. Products were Essentiel Elements of San Fran which were replaced with new products each day •À_ no penny pinching on these items. Our room was on the 6th floor. Only point to note for future is the ice machines are located on the 3rd and 4th floors. By chance when we were riding the elevator it stopped on the 4th floor and there it was the ice machine sitting directly outside the doors of room number 404 and 405. Location was great •À_ across from Notre Dame Basilica and one block from Palais de Congres.Overall a great weekend away. The restaurant is very good and again the staff here were also very friendly and accommodating. Definitely recommended.","2013-09-17T11:38:19","125440.0","-3","2013-09-17T10:29:28","ZD111587","Kentucky","1950-01-01T00:00","41054","5.0"

The hotel is great value for money and a brilliant location as it is close to the main tourist areas but also to Greenwich Village and Soho. In terms of what we wanted it for (comfortable place to sleep clean good location) it was spot on. We came with a wheelchair (it is up 4 steps so not perfect) and they gave us a room on the ground floor and somewhere to store the chair as well as being very patient storing the extra bags we had to buy at the end of the week to try and fit everything in!! They also let 2 of us stay in the room longer than normal check out time on the last day when we were hungover and had a while before our plane left. You have to share a toilet and the showers can be temperamental going from hot to cold but it was clean well cared for and nicely decorated. I was ill during the holiday and had to spend a day in bed which I wasn't happy about but I would have been massively more gutted had I not had a nice bed to snuggle up in to get better quicker. If you are planning to stay in alot then you'll want more but if you ARE planning to do that in New York you are in the wrong city! Would definitely recommend it and/ or visit again.","2013-09-17T14:07:46","141661.0","5","2013-09-17T12:11:32","ZD111200","Michigan","1951-01-01T00:00","48150","5.0"

Hotel availability in London was very limited and this was almost all we were able to get as two triple rooms. The good points:1 Staff - they were very friendly and extremely helpful. Our rooms were on different floors but they explained why before we arrived and were quite prepared to move us for the second and third nights as best they could. In the end we didn't find the different levels much of an issue and stayed put.2 Parking - I was able to park outside the front door of the hotel for a very resonable price - far cheaper than anything else in central London.3 Location Sussex gardens is a very good location for exploring London - there are a lot of buses nearby and a good selection of restaurants and shops.Downsides - these should be seen in the context of the very cheap price of roomsRooms - One of our rooms was in the basement and the window was internal overlooking a staircase - noisy in the morning. The other on the 4th floor overlooked the street and traffic noise was high all night (single glazed ill fitting sash window) - a problem if you are used to the silence of rural living.The rooms are basic but clean and though the en-suites are a little tired they are servicable and adequate.Breakfast room was clean and pleasant enough though the cofee is undrinkable and the white toast the worst cheapest glutinous sort - if you can go out to one of the fantastic cafes nearby do so.There is no bar or restaurant on site which was a porblem for us as we couldn't leave the kids on there own in the hotel.Over-all we felt what we got was about right for what we paid with the bonus of a great location. In hind-site we would have booked earlier and found somewher a bit more expensive and just a bit more comfortable.","2013-09-17T13:22:29","127337.0","-3","2013-09-17T13:10:37","ZD111365","New Mexico","1968-01-01T00:00","87114","5.0"

No it is not the Ritz or even the Hyatt but the hotel is well located the rooms we had were well maintained the staff is a delight and did I mention the location.We were in the city for theater and the Novotel is located in the heart of the theater district. 52nd and Broadway 2 buildings off Broadway. Rooms were modest but clean. Bedding was a little soft and pillows a little small. I have included actual photos of the room and the bathroom. Carpeting was very clean hallways well lighted and looked newly wallpapered. No room was more than 1 hallway down from the elevator with straight sight lines.Hair dryer was an older Conair model with a slow blow and there was no magnifying mirror in the bathroom...on the other hand the bathroom was very well lit and had a ceiling fan to avoid steaming the whole room. Water pressure in the shower (with an adjustable shower head) was high and the water hot! The front desk staff and the bell staff were all above and beyond in friendliness and courtesy. The doorman Arthur was a delight!This hotel is an excellent value and can be booked with Funjet Vacations Midwest Vacations and I am sure many many more. I cannot tell you how much the actual room rate was because we purchased a group package but I know it was rated a 3* and was one of the best priced at that rating.","2013-09-17T13:21:08","141810.0","-2","2013-09-17T10:55:55","ZD111379","New York","1952-01-01T00:00","10465","5.0"

The rooms while small (most hotel rooms in NYC are small anyway) are well appointed and comfortable. Each room has a nice flat panel television a comfotable bed and an excellent bathroom. My only complaint is that rooms are given out based upon when you checked in (unless you reserve a suite); therefore you could feasibly get stuck in a smoking room...but it is not that bad.One of the best features of this hotel is its bars. The rooftop bar is absolutely fabulous!! Unbelievable views and great drinks. As they say...it is the place to see and be seen. Try their mixed berry Mohito.Another benefit of this hotel is that it is centrally located in Soho. Bars and restaurants are at your fingertips.The staff is very friendly.

Hotel under renovations. Rooms are decent if small. Public areas are grand. The hotel is missing something special about it. Maybe its the renovations. The hotel seemed empty to me over New Years in London.","2013-09-17T14:09:24","108827.0","1","2013-09-17T12:42:06","ZD111367","North Carolina","2017-01-01T00:00","28246","5.0"

In the lovely French quarter not more than 15 minutes walk or taxi from anything you want to see. We spent 5 days here and happily spent 2 in the room reading and relaxing. If you don't want a western chain hotel near the tourist traps with 1000 rooms stay here. The breakfast and executive club are more than adequate but not quite at 5* level on variety. Cannot fault the quality and cleanliness and service. We had a lakeview room and suspect the rooms overlooking the shopping centre are less attractive (and less costly). Bed a bit small when you expect a king size but quite comfortable. Great amenities. If I had to come back to Shanghai for business (probably the only reason I'd go back) I'd stay here.","2013-09-17T12:42:40","148571.0","-2","2013-09-17T09:32:37","ZD111394","Ohio","1996-01-01T00:00","44620","5.0"

Rooms can be much of a muchness there are only so many things you can do to a room to make it look nice. Service is the key for me in 5 star hotels. Charging lofty prices should signify a dramatic shift in service compared to a 4 star hotel. This is certainly true of American Middle and Far East Hotels. I have found a consistent level of poor service at London 5 star hotels. This hotel is no exception.I came to this hotel at 2.15pm and there was NO DOORMAN. In fact it was a bit confusing where the entrance is on this property. In fact I never saw a doorman during my whole stay. A little thing yet to me shows a lack of 5 star service standards. As soon as I walked through the self opened door there was the most awful smell of fish. It was horrendous. I was greeted by a female receptionist. I noted that there was a terrible smell her reply Well I can't smell it! She was so indignant there was no smell. She was incredibly rude. Then a male receptionist came and sniffed the air and suggested the smell was paint. There was no doubt it was fish as the restaurant is in front of the reception. I have never smelt anything as bad as this at a hotel of this standard. Next problem the receptionist wanted to take my credit card to pre authorise •À_100 in case I use the mini bar. I had a bad experience 3 years ago at another 5 star London hotel who pre authorised •À_350 and it took a month to get the money back. I now refuse to hand over any card. I prefer the mini bar to be locked. This issue turned into an argument. I was told I was not allowed to check into my room until I handed over a card. I was told this time after time even though I had pre paid for the room. I asked the receptionist to lock the mini bar. This did not work she still insisted I had to hand over a card to get the key. I refused so she warned me that Everything will be removed from your room if I did not hand over a card. Again this woman was so rude. It took 10 minutes of constant arguing to resolve this the mini bar would be locked and everything (food) would be removed from my room.Next problem I was staying on a discounted room rate booked through the hotels own web site but with a discount code. I asked for a bill for the amount already charged to my credit card. The receptionist refused to give me a receipt and told me to get one from the travel agent. Yep this woman must score 10 out of 10 for most unhelpful rude receptionist I have met this year. Her impressive manner was about to get even better. As part of the deal I received 60% discount on breakfast at •À_27.00. She charged me •À_9.00 cash on the initial day. When checking out the same receptionist told me I owed another •À_1.80 as she had undercharged me for breakfast the previous day. Her mistake yet I was embarrassed by her shouting this across reception as I was leaving. Incredibly bad. Is it not better to ignore the •À_1.80 than embarrass a customer for your own mistake or is this hotel so hard up it must have the •À_1.80 and allow a customer to be embarrassed? Once singed in I was given a towel to refresh myself that was freezing cold then asked by aforementioned receptionist if I wanted to be shown my room. Sorry this should be automatic remember the concept of 5 star service! This lady had not got a clue. I was never addressed by Dr but always as Mr yet my booking and breakfast receipt showed the pre fix was Dr. Yet another small thing yet so important to a person to get their name right.The saving grace of this hotel was the room and housekeeping service. Very nice room with my own coffee machine. Simple but nice bathroom great shower gels etc. Very comfy bed. The room was cleaned again with the turndown service with fresh towels and more gels and milk being provided. Only thing we did not get was a chocolate or a weather forecast on the pillow as many 5 star properties give.I went out that night and returned late once again no doorman the receptionist never looked up to greet me.The breakfast the next morning was very nicely presented but cold. If I had not been in such a rush to get to my meeting it would have gone back.This hotel is a very nice but it is badly let down by a rude obnoxious receptionist. The biggest saving grace for me was the price I paid. This hotel would attract me back through the door again at full price on the basis of the room it was very nice if the service met a 5 star standard but wild horses would not drag me back to this hotel whilst their reception staff treat customers in the way I was treated. Great room poor service sum up this hotel. What a shame as it is such a nice room.","2013-09-17T14:42:25","132557.0","4","2013-09-17T10:49:44","ZD111504","Ohio","1960-01-01T00:00","43010","5.0"

I was a bit dismayed by the drabness of the rooms and dirty carpet but praise the location the view the helpfullness of the staff the spaciousness of the living room the full kitchen/dining area and the view the view and the view. We had very warm days and cool nights so found it nice at night in spite of the city noise-loved to hear the cable car bell. The Powell (Hyde or Mason) Cable car stop is a block down a decent hill and the Mark Hopkins is directly across the street up a very steep hill. It costs about $8for a taxi from the Wharf and about $40-45 to the airport. You are 5 minutes away from Sears (for breakfast even during lunch) and the shopping at Union Sq. and about the same from Chinatown. The wharf is better reached via Cable Car trolley (from Powell/Market) taxi or bus. It is very doable (no hills) by walking to Chinatown then through little Italy but can be long. Our stay with the on-line rebate averaged $200 a night a steal in this city. I wish it had been better updated the carpet scared me. I would recommend to families on a budget who want to stay on Nob Hill. The kitchen was great for bringing back cracked crabs and enjoying them in the room.","2013-09-17T12:52:45","138091.0","0","2013-09-17T11:14:42","ZD111325","Ohio","1988-01-01T00:00","44114","5.0"
